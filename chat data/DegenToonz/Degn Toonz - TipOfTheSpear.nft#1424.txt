continued volume is what is important


[09-Mar-22 05:12 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
that, along with undeniable next level art, are the reasons I bought back in, above the floor, in a bear market


[09-Mar-22 05:26 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
this is what is important. You mix good volume, a thin floor, and a positiver community attitude, and the result is pretty easy to see.


[09-Mar-22 05:27 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
Yes sir. Literally exactly what I wanted popped up...less expensive than I thought it would be, and rare too! I am sofakingexcited

been in BAYC since May, and I can say this place has super legit vibes. As good of art as you'll find, and a strengthening community. Just aped BACK in today after seeing the project survive the first hurdles, and still be around.

its all about the people in this room. Thats what everyone who couldnt figure out what was so special about BAYC had...die hard mf'ers who wouldnt sell, and others who took the community, and ran with it. If we really wanna see this place keep growing, we need derivatives, community projects, etc. The artists and devs have for the most part done their job. Now its on us.

@Dariodesiena is SUPER OG in the BAYC world, and was one of, if not the first dude doing derivatives. Also happens to be a degen holder.

those are the creators and devs. i am talking about the people from the community using their IP to build on their own

Amazing art
Great volume
Strong community

As long as devs run a perfect race, and people stick around, I think it will do well.

I legit think if we can keep the volume up, and get to a 1eth floor, it could take off.

I stated earlier, we need engagement from artists, etc, in the community.

Derivatives, community projects, etc hopefully come.

There are a ton of existing ideas from other projects that could be adapted here.

when you see enough projects, it gets easier and easier to see the ones that have major red flags, and to isolate the traits that make stuff take off. So far DT is running a perfect race IMO

that is a tricky discussion. It is as close to impossible as there is that you wont actually be HACKED. 99.99999999999999% of those people, have actually signed a malicious transaction, and actually just sent their shit right out, or gave someone permission to do so

if you already minted them, and they are already in your wallet, you SHOULD be ok. Exceptions to that are if the original contract you signed had anything sketchy in it. Its possible to sign a transaction that you believe is totally valid, but for the attacker to not act for a while. This is why you dont keep any valuable assets in any wallet you have ever mionthed from.

👀 (3) 

[10-Mar-22 08:38 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
the entire point is that your seed is never typed in anywhere, or exposed to the internet, ever...at all. When you go to approve a transaction, it actually takes it offline, into the ledger, signs it offline, then spits out the signed transaction, ready for approval. This way your seed never touched the internet

Not offended, its a legit question. For apes, it highlights the fact that we own the rights to our NFT's, and that the community can/will drive a ton of the action. Also, getting a famous artist associated with your brand, having hios foloowers eyes on it...also a good thing.

Morning degenz


[10-Mar-22 11:35 PM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
So, just a little perspective here. Literally EVERY ape space, chat, etc has every new project coming in, saying, "no, I'm telling you, pixel cat degen ape meta monster gods are gonna be the next BAYC". Kinda gets to the point where discussions are hijacked. And honestly, is super frustrating. So as much as we love our degenz, when/if we go into someone else's space, and try promoting our project (even if you think you are doing it on the DL, you are not), we are most likely going to be met with resistence.

if we are gonna be a strong group, we gotta get away from shaming people who sell, flip etc. Everyone has their own reasons to buy/sell. Also, from a positive perspective, building the base of buyers with a higher cost average is good for the project. This is the best way to increase the price. The rest of us just HAVE to stay positive, keep the energy high in here and on twitter, and welcome the new toonz with open arms.

that might have not been the best choice of words. Maybe the better way to say it is, lets not be so worried about the people who sell, and more about the new ones that buy, and keeping the energy positive. Cancer and negative energy will spread like wildfire if we let it in.

The seed is never exposed in a hardware wallet once you srt it up. The transaction is sent inside the device, where it is signed offline, and the signed transaction is sent out to be verified.

Nah... PLENTY of money to be made buying/flipping secondary

Just make sure you're buying a project with good volume. And be patient to wait for good deals. Get a rarity sniper.


[16-Mar-22 02:00 PM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
This is all a risk.

Buying a project that's already minted out, and has steady volume is FAR less risky than just always minting.


[16-Mar-22 02:00 PM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
These accounts can be purchased easily


[16-Mar-22 02:01 PM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
😂.... You don't know it's gonna sell for .8 when it's minting for .06

[16-Mar-22 02:04 PM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
No, you cannot. You can do it with projects that mi t out, have high volume, and raise in price.

Maybe 1% of all projects.

I remain confident that Prince and Bader  will hear our plight, feel our pain, and understand the ONLY thing this community is missing are GIFs. There is truly no reason we cannot have them enabled. Literally EVERY other major, and even minor project is able to figure it out. We need to figure it out.

[22-Mar-22 03:04 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
Trying not to tag them, because I know that gets old. But its really not a hard thing to fix. Not sure if we just need more mods in here to be able to monitor bad links, better education of the community to understand personal responsability, or something else. It is frustrating though...and were it not for this, I would be in here even more I'm sure.

currently onboarding 2 new friends to NFT, and they will start their journeys with TOONZ. Cant wait for them to see how great this crew is. They will however be spoiled from most other projects moving forward, as TOONZ is kind of an unrealistic expectation to put on other projects, lol.

part of the appeal is the non-stop discord we have here. If that gets split to 2-3 rooms, it will drastically be affected.

[29-Mar-22 01:12 PM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
Just tried gif using giphy.... No go


[29-Mar-22 01:13 PM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
No


[29-Mar-22 01:13 PM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
Looks like there is a workaround


[29-Mar-22 01:13 PM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
I can sesrch the gifs, but it gets blocked


[29-Mar-22 01:15 PM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
You're just selecting the little gif icon, and choosing?


[29-Mar-22 01:16 PM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
Fuck, I must be an idiot. Won't even let me long press and copy. Guess I'm just not gif material! 😂

You are using the entire giphy keyboard, or it just plugs into your existing keyboard?

and the answer is no, I dont actually know what a "double chin ass toon" is, but the shit just sounded so good when Zungry said it the other day, I cant get it out of my head. And it plays in his voice, with his accent too everytime I think about it...lol

I've also seen several people mention this on Twitter. Right now we just have to stay positive, and remain confident the guys are hard at work on the backend..

I believe Prince said we are getting an announcement today, so maybe that will help spark some momentum.

So I don't know what's going on, but this project vs project stuff is not helping our cause. If we're gonna be a strong project, that leads from the front, we can't get into the habit of feeling like we have to to constantly compare.

I'd love to see us focus on building Degen toonz, more than what anyone else is doing..

We're no different from anyone else if we do the same shit they do.

Just my opinion.

Yeah, nothing wrong with that. I vote in the poles!

The organic ones (if there is such a thing, lol) are one thing... But us creating a poll where we load up, like we've seen others try and do to us, does no good.

We can rise above the BS though by not reacting, and staying classy.

as @ZUNGRY hinted, this is really not a great look for us overall. Nobody wants to be part of a club they're begged to join. We DEF dont need this one fake ass dude to MAYBE buy a toon. We need to be walking around 24/7 with the BDE, and give off the vibe we want to portray. Confident in ourselves, our project, and our family. Fuck these engagement farming mf'ers.

It can have its moments. I work hard to disconnect from the result, and just stay steady. Been at the same gig for quite a while, so kinda on cruise control at this point.

Had my time to work 50 hours a week when I was green. Now I just let all the young, anxious bulls run down the hill, and fuck one cow. I walk down at a leisurely pace, an fuck 'em all!!!  (I mean that from a patience perspective, not actually fucking over my customers, lol)

Well, he sold twice yesterday. Soooo..... Somewhere in that range. If I remember, it did t sell at .6999, and did at .5


So maybe  .65?


[03-Apr-22 10:59 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
Fair to be cautious of your investment. You know how it is, there is a fine line between discussion and FUD in our world..


Maybe this will put your mind at ease..


Only 78 people think a toon is worth less than a half an eth.... Out of 8888

Timing of the initial run up stunted the growth. We are in a slightly slower burn now..... But that's actually better.

The fact that the fp has sunk, and optimism is so high in here all the time, should be what's really driving your decision making.

in te past 20 years the overwhelming majority of "financial analysts" dont even come close to beating the s&p 500. Literally, all a person had to do was stick their money in, and do better.

some fair points here. I think where we are not seeing eye to eye is the "smartest guy in the room" comment. I think people are fooled into thinking they are not capable of doing it (using the same media manipulation that causes us to pay thousands for little clear stones called diamonds).

nope, can pay with ETH in CRO card as well

yes, using the "top off" feature

you should look into UST staking with Terra/anchor


[04-Apr-22 12:56 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
19.5%


[04-Apr-22 12:57 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
and this is just true staking to limit market supply and put more UST into circulation

honestly, he comes across as an ETH maxi feeling his space invaded a bit. Nothing really but a bunch of buzzwords in that post. I see nothing that concerns me. I am HEAVILY invested in UST.

His main concerns seem to be how it will affect ETH.


[04-Apr-22 01:03 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
and every dollar/coin that touches a smart contract is at risk of hack/loss.


[04-Apr-22 01:04 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
So really he is just trying to scare people, and most lilkely salty he missed the bus on TERRA


[04-Apr-22 01:05 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
I just dont see what the ADDITIONAL risks are, that we dont face with literally EVERY project that uses smart contracts


[04-Apr-22 01:05 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
I will look into it more, as I may very well have a blind spot here


[04-Apr-22 01:08 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
Luna and Terra, while clearly related, are separated for a reason. The btc buying bolsters the UST, doesn't affect Terra directly.

Which is why having it back an algorithmic stable coin makes so much sense.

I think the guy who made the post doesn't fully understand the tokenomics behind how LUNA is burned to Create the UST.

Also Degen toon crew, we have to find some other ways to spread our message. I think we have all beat Twitter into the ground with the Twitter raids and stuff. I know for one when I see it ad nauseum, it kinda turns me off to a project.

Out of 8888 pieces, only 207 toonz have owners that value them at less than .75 eth.


If you value your toon, and wanna be a part of something amazing.... Delist it.

I am starting the home for wayward toonz. Unloved, neglected toonz will be able to find a safe, secure home in my wallet. Where I will keep them safe and secure, for ever and ever.

I'm with you ser. There is a difference between kind and nice. If we expect to hold the founders accountable, we have to first hold ourselves accountable. Like the people posting shit to  sell in here with no repercussions, etc. We either have a community that acts in our own interests, and tries to build this up...or we have a group of fakers that do nothing but try to extract .05 in gainz and move on to some other project. I would not be in here waisting my time, energy OR eth if I didnt believe in the project. But what we need to realize is this is now OUR PROJECT. Once the founders mint, their only true motivation (everyone, not just here) is to keep secondary sales going so the eth payouts continue. WE need to police ourselves, and create the culture we want. That will flow upwards to the founders.

We have to agree by some basic rules guys and gals.

If you value your toonz, delist.

Just gotta follow the $.

Everytime we buy something, 3% vanishes.

This solves that problem.

It's inevitable.

Selling into the pump makes me sad.

Basic TOON Guidelines (how to be a good toon)

1. Always have fun
2. Always support your fellow toonz
3. Never sell your toonz!
4. If you have to sell your toon, do it the right way (don’t torch the place on your way out)
5. Share your love of toonz with others
6. Be cool
7. Don’t shill ANYTHING in general, ever


Follow these 7 simple guidelines for maximum toonage

or at least dont lob grenades on your way out the door

Difference between being lucky and fortunate. Lucky implies you didn't have any part in it. Fortunate because yiu know a good thing when you see it, and have the ability to act on it.

OMG, I am dying........Like many, my dog is very particular about where she poops in the backyard. Only in one small area, and the poop has to be regularly removed, or she wont go. So, yesterday my yard was roto-tilled. She just went out this morning, and its like she thought the ENTIRE back yard was covered with poop from side to side. Took her like 5 minutes to sniff them all, and realize she was safe!!! hahahahaha

Basic TOON Guidelines (how to be a good toon)

1. Always have fun
2. Always support your fellow toonz
3. Never sell your toonz!
4. If you have to sell your toon, do it the right way (don’t torch the place on your way out)
5. Share your love of toonz with others
6. Be cool
7. Don’t shill ANYTHING in general, ever


Follow these 7 simple guidelines for maximum toonage

We are just in a weird spot where a ton of time, effort and energy is going into making sure DT reaches its full potential, which makes people very passionate about what they are doing. And as we are trying to move up, there are those that just wont allow it, which is frustrating. Harder to reach that helping hand back when the person you are reaching for is pulling you backwards. So sometimes its a little bit of tough love, but like all tough love, its done so both parties will grow.

Only 244 toonz are currently owned by people that value them at less than .75ETH...out of 8888. Take a moment to realize how insanely apeish that is.

I actually just think its new people that dont realize this extended consolidation is actually such a strong sign. They see no upward movement, and panic. When in actuality, not continuing to fall is the strong sign. A quick up and down does nobody any good. Once those people realize if they just stop, for literally like 1 or 2 days, they will actually get more money....we will begin our ascension. Until then, as frustrating as it is, we just have to remain strong, continue to try and keep the momentum, and have faith WAAGMI

Only 211 Toonz are owned by people who value them at less than .75ETH. Out of 8888. Look at where this number was just this morning. Probably nothing.

Basic TOON Guidelines (how to be a good toon)

1. Always have fun
2. Always support your fellow toonz
3. Never sell your toonz!
4. If you have to sell your toon, do it the right way (don’t torch the place on your way out)
5. Share your love of toonz with others
6. Be cool
7. Don’t shill ANYTHING in general, ever


Follow these 7 simple guidelines for maximum toonage

It's OK. It's a very simple concept. If you minted, you got one. If you didn't, you didn't.


Absolutely no place for FUD in here..


Today we implement the zero FUD policy. Multiple warnings can/will result in a timeout.

@ngostalgic_ guessing you will have to wait for them to roll out coinbase nft, and hopefully they use that address.

If not, sad to say, but you most likely lost those assets otherwise.

❤️ 

[18-Apr-22 02:33 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
These guys have no ability to sign a transaction on that wallet afaik. Gonna require him to somehow have the keys for that address, which will never happen. Hopefully, maybe, they let people use their existing addresses for coinbase nft, giving him the ability to sign.


[18-Apr-22 02:35 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
Yep.

@ngostalgic_ please drop the tweet you create to these coinbase guys, so we can all share.

Make sure you mention how they can have a chance to help the NFT culture here. Or something like that.

They are desperate for brownie points with the community.

Basic TOON Guidelines (how to be a good toon)

1. Always have fun
2. Always support your fellow toonz
3. Never sell your toonz!
4. If you have to sell your toon, do it the right way (don’t torch the place on your way out)
5. Share your love of toonz with others
6. Be cool
7. Don’t shill ANYTHING in general, ever
8. No FUD!!! 

Follow these 8 simple guidelines for maximum toonage

(Please feel free to add whatever I am missing)

There are three parts:

Art

Team

Community



We know the art is amazing.

We know we are in here, and on Twitter, doing our parts.

We want/need the team in the background doing their thing, popping in here when they come up for breath!

When these three things converge, great things can/will happen.

Just hang and stack sir. We wanna see you get a toon, but continued mentioning of it, and kinda hinting around donations, people giving eth, toonz, etc could be perceived the wrong way.


[19-Apr-22 09:22 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
So I have a theory it may have something to do with stacked roles.

I am going to try removing all but the Degen role and see if this stops this from happening.


[19-Apr-22 09:23 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
It's a discord role stacking issue I believe.

Only 269 TOONZ are owned by people that value them at less than .75 ETH...out of 8888.  That is 3.0265526552655%       Take a minute to think about that.

How many gambles in life can you decide at some point you want out, and get some/most/all of your money back?? This shit is so unique. When you feel your $$$ is not being put to good use, you gotta do what you did...realocate.

If you don't have a toon, buy one.

If you have one, buy another. 

If you have multiple, you know this addiction doesn't stop, so just quit fucking around, and go buy another one.

Whales selling to themselves to make it look better. Literally the underlying theory of the entire project.


[24-Apr-22 07:19 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
Just look at the OG project. A perfect example of manipulation. Then, they used that manipulation to jump start this manipulation.

Gave a TON for free to celebs and influencers.

Only 83 toonz valued by their owners at less that .75 eth.

Yesterday morning this was 225!


If you have a toon, delist it.

If you have spare eth, buy a toon.

You are now a part of something special.


Act accordingly!

We have made it through consolidation, and are now on the move.

PSA for the afternoon....

If you have a toon listed, wtf are you doing?

Do you see what's happening? 

These are the times greatness is built. 

Be strong, REAL profits go to the patient.

These even numbers are critical resistance.

As soon as someone decides to break rank, and list below the floor.... ESPECIALLY at a number like .6 it's can quickly cause a cascade, and more people to undercut.

Be strong toonz.

Are you trying to make a fraction of an eth, or multiple eth?

Time in the market is far more valuable than timing the market, which is damn near impossible.

If you don't have all you need... Buy, then buy some more. Then plan on being on a schedule to just buy everytime you have available cash.

Dollar cost average is THE best way to attain life changing wealth in crypto.

OK crew.... We've had a SMALL step backwards... Which with the eth drop is not that big of a deal.

Time to take back the momentum.

Delist.

If you can buy, grab one.

If you know someone listed, "help" them understand how this affects us all.

We have GOT to get these  < .6 toons sold.

You know what's an issue? People in here pretending to be real, until the first sign of rough water..

Thanks for trying to torch the place on your way out!

I'll have a special message for those people when they inevitably return when the price continues back up..

The message will be, you are not welcome here.

Seriously....i will not relent on these people.. You are either with us, or against us. And if you are against us, watch out.

No issue if someone wants or needs to sell.but as we've said 1k times, this battle to undercut is fucking bullshit, and will be treated as such.

Not everyone is made for this shit.

You guys can all be focused on namaste, and being nice.

I wish this update was better... But we gotta know where we are to know how to get to our destination.

There are 93 toonz now valued under .75  (up from 62 2 days ago).

We had a nice push, and many have now taken their .1 profit.

Let's buckle down, delist, buy one if you can, and crank this hype machine back up!

Agreed. I know I'm the first to charge into battle, but with the eth fluctuation, and the huge push we made from .38 to .6, there are bound to be a ton of people looking for a quick buck.

Hopefully everytime this happens we end up with a stronger and stronger core of people.

Anything you sell for 4 eth each (beside fur, and a few others) would be a huge win, and would not hurt anyone... Just the opposite.

It's the people that buy when the shouldn't, with eth they don't have to spend (got a bill to pay, car breaks, etc... And the need is to sell the eth) that kill shit.

If you are buying with eth you need in an emergency... Dont buy.

Sell your eth for Fiat, and put aside a reasonable rainy day fund before you get into crypto.

[27-Apr-22 05:14 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
Basic TOON Guidelines (how to be a good toon)

1. Always have fun
2. Always support your fellow toonz
3. Never sell your toonz!
4. If you have to sell your toon, do it the right way (don’t torch the place on your way out)
5. Share your love of toonz with others
6. Be cool
7. Don’t shill ANYTHING in general, ever
8. No FUD!!! 

Follow these 8 simple guidelines for maximum toonage

(Please feel free to add whatever I am missing)

How many gambles in life can you get down the rabbit hole, realize there is an issue, and get a huge portion of your money back?

Moving from a bad project to a good one is never a bad thing.

That's where we have to have a clear line of delineation.

There is no shame in selling.

There is however MUCH shame in undercutting the floor and panic selling.

Just requires a little more patience, but is better for everyone.

Issue is, most people now are smart enough to know when they do that, especially at critical levels, it causes fear in others, and will start a slide.

Because they know that, and do it anyway, it's basically a giant middle finger to all of us.

And you guys already know how I view people trying to tear down what we are building.

Warpath.

We don't need to be worried on our end, because we are not selling.

But the floor is the foundation. When it's weak, everything built on top of it will be weak.

[28-Apr-22 06:18 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
I don't.

The logic over on THAT side is.

Faster. More. Free. Repeat.

Sadly, these are usually the same people that contribute absolutely nothing to the project.


[28-Apr-22 06:22 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
So they're impatient?

But at the same time, want the price to go up, have constant announcements, value, utility, etc.

Just has to be on their time frame.

OK, I get it now.

I'm not saying I disagree, and that I actually prefer that as well.

However, that's just not the world we live in.

A lot of the same people that say they're ok with no hype, announcements etc, would also be the ones who will sell when/if the price drops....BECAUSE there is no hype.

Please DO NOT buy a Toon if:

1. You will "need liquid" any time soon, for anything
2. You are using your bill/rent money


Please DO buy toon if:

1. You are committed to being patient
2. You are financially stable, and using extra funds that won't be needed for IRL

Follow these simple guidelines for success.

Good time to post this again.


[02-May-22 12:13 PM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424 (pinned)
Basic TOON Guidelines (how to be a good toon)

1. Always have fun
2. Always support your fellow toonz
3. Never sell your toonz!
4. If you have to sell your toon, do it the right way (don’t torch the place on your way out)
5. Share your love of toonz with others
6. Be cool
7. Don’t shill ANYTHING in general, ever
8. No FUD!!! 

Follow these 8 simple guidelines for maximum toonage

(Please feel free to add whatever I am missing)

Attention toonz.

We are in a danger zone.

If the toonz that popped under .6 don't get scooped or delisted, we are likely going to have more Kevins slide under.

Buy one if you can, or for God's sake, if you own one..... Delist or at least raise the price.

Only 212 TOTAL TOONZ are valued at less than 1ETH. Out of 8888. That is insanely thin. The rocket ship is fueled. If you have a toon listed, take it down!! If you have funds on the side waiting for an entry point, THIS IS IT!!!

Just look at the path of dead projects that lay in our wake. They get a week or two of hype, then done. We have not only NOT died,  but we have managed to thrive in a crypto downturn, and during the largest liquidity suck in HISTORY. If you are not MEGA APEISH on Toonz, then you have clearly not been paying attention.

OK, I don't wanna freak everyone out, but.... You know we're about to be ALL OVER the trending sites.

That means more buyers are about to flood in.

If you don't want your toon to be lost forever, you may wanna delist.

They had a decent little run. Just another example of what the other type of projects look like. Quick pump, then fade away forever.

It's so hard to get eyes on a project.

It's 10x harder to get eyes BACK on a project.

We have done that.

You should all be proud of what you are helping build.

He was one of the first people to do a BAYC derivative. He's in the rolling stone magazine for BAYC.

Now he just did a derivative of HIS toon.

Ok toonz, time to kick it into gear. Apparently the listers came out in full force last night. Happy to say at least they started listing above the floor, which is great news!!!!! However, we are approaching 800 listing again (was like 670 or something last night). If this continues, the listings will eventually outpace the sales, then simple supply and demand take over. Sooooooooo

your ledger is just how you authorize a transaction. Toonz still all live on the eth blockchain. You will have no issues doing what you need to do with your ledger.

I am asking every toon to take a deep look at yourself, and ask, "what do I really want out of this". If the answer is "I wanna make .08 profit and move on", then please do so quickly. However, if you are more of a "I wanna make soem real ETH person", settle in, buckle down, and dont list your toonz....for a LONG TIME,

So clearly we don't want peope undercutting, but some will just never get it.

Let's make sure we stay positive, keep the buying pressure high, and push through this.

We just had a MEGA PUMP.

There will always be those that take profit.

FYI....I am going to create a super exclusive "diamond hands" role. Will be coming in roughly a week. Will only be given to anyone that has ZERO TOONZ LISTED for at least a week. Will have a room where you drop your Opensea account, and we will look at listings. If we see nothing, you will get the VERY EXCLUSIVE diamond hands role.

Seriously toonz, this is the warm up stage to make sure everyone is ready for what's next.

Imagine when we have a huge pump in the future, say to 10 eth, then fall back to 5 or 6.

Then 30 to 15......or 20 to 10.

Thats when your diamond hands will truly be tested.

Ah, yeah. Well, just be patient. They didn't tell you when, or how much to pay. Those variables are on you.


[08-May-22 01:18 PM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
But their assets have never not increased over time, so as long as you didn't buy for a quick flip, you'll be good.

But I am a huge supporter of YUGA, and have been for over a year. So just as I would question the motives of someone fudding Degen toonz, I question when someone makes a purchase of the own volition, then comes and tries to shift the blame elsewhere.

Plus my skin doesn't take detail on tats very well.

Just 91 toonz valued by their owners at less than 1 ETH.


[11-May-22 02:08 PM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
No. That's an unfair comparison to make any project try and live up to.

However, it is the 1st Degen toonz, and I can say without a doubt the best current project to be getting involved in.

[12-May-22 02:31 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
but yes, you can list from the ledger


[12-May-22 02:31 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
You should have your ledger connected to metamask


[12-May-22 02:32 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
then the process is the same, you are just doing the final acceptance of the transaction on the ledger, so your seed never gets exposed to the internet


[12-May-22 02:32 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
will kill the listing if you move it. Just be careful, old listing can still be reactivated were you to move it back to that wallet.

[12-May-22 02:34 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
depends on the UI. Ledger can take longer to say it for instance if it waits for 100 confirmations, compared to maybe 50 on metamask or whatever

No. 3 positions you perfectly for the future.

1 to eventually recoup your total cost.

three decisions, all three good as long as they were played correctly, were available to every person, and hopefully you are already mid plan at this point. 1. Ride out the storm with your eth no matter what  2. Convert your eth to stable coins, and wait to buy back in at a lower price  3. Have your eth in NFT projects you believe in

always buy with your debit card if possible


[13-May-22 07:37 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
slightly higher fees, but instant withdraw


[13-May-22 07:37 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
if you lose the asset your are trying to buy, or have it locked for weeks, both are deal killers


[13-May-22 07:37 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
or wire transfer for large amounts


[13-May-22 07:38 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
same day access

There are 804 wayward toonz. These toonz have yet to find their forever homes. Needless to say, this makes them, and me very sad. It should make you very sad too! If you have an open place in your heart, adopt one of these little fellas! If you yourself are currently emotionally abusing your toon by trying to show it the door, I ask that you realize the lifelong impact you are having on their psyche. Do the right thing!!

Until just last night a prominent member of this community was unprotected. If you have any fear or questions, please reach out to me and I am happy to help walk you through it safely.

when you look up the definition of a solid leader of a group in the dictionary, @CryptologistG is the image you see. Always willing to help, supports people regardless of the presense or size of their collection, helps new people get in. Etc. Thanks for all you do bro!

If you can buy, buy.

If you have toonz listed, be a toon and get those things down!

Nobody will be sitting around in a year talking about the .25 you made selling your toon...

But if you are patient, and play your cards right, you could be sitting around telling the story about how you helped build Degen toonz.

Just go look at the price pattern for BAYC. Huge run up, big pull back. New value introduced, rinse and repeat. The biggest mistake I made was trying to worry about flipping apes during those times. Had I just bought more and held, things would be very different.

a combination of patience, and reachiing out to opensea and keeping the pressure on them to ptove you are not the scammer, and are a legit holder of the item. You can also see about contacting the person who lost it, and trying to convince them to contact opensea. Many have had luck, but it usually takes 6-8 weeks from what I have heard.

The little bit of profit you can make right now as we pump IS NOT worth being the person that forever tells the story about how "you had a sweet Degen toon, but sold it at 1.xxx"

If you sell now, enjoy whatever nominal profit you make. Chances are you get left behind, or have to significantly downgrade your toon to get back in.

Just love the toon ya got.

Sit back, relax, and toon in.

what good does it do there?? lol


[16-May-22 09:30 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
decent chance he isnt going to make it. Not sure buying then selling for a loss is sustainable.


[16-May-22 09:32 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
not with patience. What today seems way over the floor, will be THE floor soon. Most people too impatient. Just sit back, smoke a fatty, enjoy the vibes, and watch the value of your toonz go up! Simple formula.

You know we will see 100x waves of "no I am here for life". Then they will take their profit, sell to a stronger holder, and move on. Will be interesting to see how many can hold to make the real profits!!

Zoom that outlook out a bit.... Stop thinking of what the price is this hour, and think about in another month, 3 months, 1 year.

More profits, less stress.

Will be a little dip, but getting the tnt is just the first part.

Using it will certainly come later. My guess would be NFT NYC just based on the existing timeliness.

Both will have incentive. The deflationary aspect combined with some people choosing to just buy/hold tnt will be awesome..

Basic TOON Guidelines (how to be a good toon)

1. Always have fun
2. Always support your fellow toonz
3. Never sell your toonz!
4. If you have to sell your toon, do it the right way (don’t torch the place on your way out)
5. Share your love of toonz with others
6. Be cool
7. Don’t shill ANYTHING in general, ever
8. No FUD!!! 

Follow these 8 simple guidelines for maximum toonage

(Please feel free to add whatever I am missing)

Unique owner count.

To all of the new people...You have stumbled into THE project. Many will use it to flip, and make a quick profit and move on. Many will realize this is something special, and will strap in for the real ride to HUGE profits. Either way, we are happy you had a chance to be a part of the toonz journey!!!

we are headed into toonzday. Most projects die during the middle of the week....we have commmunity wide spaces with the whole crew, and founders every toonzday and Friday. This is where most of the alpha comes from, and keeps the train rolling right into the weekend. Its a beautiful cirle.

here is the move....buy the toon you want, with the trait you love, at whatever price it takes to get today (within reason). Then be patient for JUST A LITTLE WHILE, and before you know if, the floor will make it to your buy price, and uip will have the toon you want. Follow me for more tips and tricks.

This. 3x in like 72 hours. If you are upset now, its because you are a flipper, and would not have provided any value to the project anyway. Mf'ers who have been here are just chillin, and the new people that are serious collectors are just waiting for the next leg.

Mf'ers have their "forever" toon for like 8 hours. Poor toons are already listed before the day is out.

Buy a toon you love.

Hold it.

Simple, SIMPLE  formula.


[17-May-22 08:14 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
Like a bunch of little squirrels on crack.

If You don't think you will like your toon in 48 hours, and you need to "upgrade" the minute you bought yours, please don't buy a toon. Wait until you find the one you LOVE.

We get 100x people all wanting to "upgrade" at once, and we know what happens.

Look past the end of you nose.

Don't let the decisions of few decide the fate of many.

The release of the tnt/asset this month will only be stage 1.

The actual use/implementation of it will almost certainly come several weeks later.


[17-May-22 11:43 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
Start thinking of your toon as an asset that will continue to deliver you more value, assets, utility and benefits over time, rather than an avenue to quickly turn your eth into slightly more eth.

This realization will free your mind, and allow you to really enjoy the process, and get maximum return on your toon.

I don't know, looks great to me.

Like toonz, and NFT'S in general, you lose sight of the big picture if you're too worried about the hour to hour, and day to day.

Youve been around a while, flipped apes, etc...

Rather than be a dick in your comments, why don't you try being helpful when passing down info.

Get a lot further that way.

Everyone is saying, "If I just list mine, no big deal, its way above floor". We now have 830 listing when we had 5xx during this last push. The supply available is DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL to the velocity. We need EVERYONE to delist. new people, OG's, and everyone in between. If you want your toonz value to increase....DELIST and be PATIENT.

If you need to move toonz, work deals with people then do private listings on OS. This keeps the listings low, provides safety for everyone, and still has the project get its cut. THIS IS THE WAY.

holy fuck toonz........we are about to pass 2 eth with 896 toonz listed!!! When the run really hits, and people start delisting again, we may have another BIG PARABOLIC move. For referrence, we had as few as 550 or so listed just a few days ago. So we have had 300 new toonz hit the market, and have STILL pumped. Once people realize wtf is happening, and actually start to value their toonz, this shit could go bananas!

RULES FOR MAKING IT RIGHT NOW


1. Do not have your toon listed, period
2. If you wanna sell, work a deal on the side, and send a private listing in OS (please ask question)
3. Don’t list your toon
4. Keep the positive attitude going
5. Toonz should not be listed right now…this is the time to be greedy. 
6. Realize the value of your toon
7. Psssstt……you HAVE STUMBLED INTO THE GEM OF 2022 (act accordingly)
8. Don’t fucking list your toon!!!
9. No crying allowed if you sell and get left behind
10. Love your fellow toonz!
11. Have fun!!!

Need all the OG's to take the lead. We have fucking pumped while people have listed like crazy.


[21-May-22 12:16 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
yes. Back over 900 again...903. We were at 5xx the other day.


[21-May-22 12:17 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
everyone is like, "well I can have mine listed, its only a few"


[21-May-22 12:17 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
then everyone does it..Then we have 903 listed.

its just always funny to me tha their greed is what causes them to actually lose money.


[21-May-22 12:21 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
Not trying to specifically call any one person out. Just pointing out that with 3700 owners, and 8888 items, when the cascade of listing starts, it often has the same effect as a sweep, but in the wrong direction. We need a unified front from all of the OG's, because we know the project is being flooded by flippers as we continue to move up.

safe to say if you own a toon, and have any plans on sticking around, you need AT LEAST one minters card. They are sofaking cheap, and there is not even one to go around for every holder. Kind of a no brainer.

Yep. The entire market has said no to that price, including me. If you wanna actually sell him, I am open to making a very fair offer. Either eth, or toon plus eth.

Also... There is one group in our community I am not proud of.

The flippers.

We have some shitty flippers.

These big mental points 1, 2,3 5,etc) are NOT the places to be selling.

Agreed. Although the eth is still in my wallet, and I decided to just right click/save his shit...so it is now mine anyway.

Just sayin...if you are in here claiming to be a ride or die toon....and talking the talk, you need to be walking the walk.

lol...I am as big of a fan of a slow burn as any. But that means we as the community have to police ourselves. And we are slippin a bit. I didnt get this name by just sitting back and waiting until the aftermath to bring shit up, and get to fixing it. I see an issue a mile out, and sound the alarm. If not me, who??? There is a time to be all happy and shit, and there is a time to rally the troops, and get the boat rowing in the same direction. This is that time.

all good. I can take a little pushback. Have to have all sides. Honestly, the new people need to here this shit more than anyone else. My role is not to baby people. Lead, follow, or the the hell out of the way is a motto I live by. I am just trying to make sure we ALL make it.

Just trying to be smart about which are the projects to flip in, and not care about what happens, and which anre not. When to list/not list....how it affects the project, etc. Also about people claiming to be ride or die toonz, then constantly throwing water on the fire by DUMPING their toonz all the time. Just a little toon up for us a community to hopefully re allign our goals, and get us all rowing in the same direction.

These grous are poison to a good project. You have to know what they dont. This is pretty much the only project doing well in the space for a consistent time right now....why tf would you intentionally wanny hold it back?? To make fractions of an eth?? Not saying you, but in general.

I received a comment that gave me some perspective. I should not be speaking about who does or does not sell/buy or list, etc. We all have different goals, situations, and are at unique points in our journey. I am just super excited about the toonz, and really want us all to succeed, so my passion bleeds into the wrong areas as times.  For this, and my general attitude this morning, I am sorry. Truly love you toonz, and only wanna be the best toon I can be. I will be better.

PSA for any toon getting a new ledger/trezor. MAKE SURE you do a small eth transaction in AND out to make sure you have full control over the wallet, and can move stuff out. Would hate to see someone get a toon stranded!!

I mean when people getting new for the first time. Just ake sure you slow down, secure your seed phrase on a metal plate if you can, and test the wallet before you send valuable assets to it.


[22-May-22 04:57 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
hmm. Yeah, make this a priority. Plug it into the metamask with the "connect hardware wallet" integration. Thats the way to use it, and you should see your stuff.

@ngostalgic_ maybe you and @Drone Rogan 🎙 can setup that ToonsUniversity idea we discussed (I think it was your idea actually). Even if its just a spaces, we can make sure we get everyone up to speed on wallet/safety practices.

a "backup" ledger is a must have though. If yours breaks, etc, you wanna have one in the box waiting so you dont have to wait weeks to process a transaction.

Rank means zero to me. Obviously rare traits are great. But as long as you like it, and it's goes together well, that's what matters.

Toonz are mainly driven by aesthetics.

I just looked. There does not appear to be any traceable info 9n the account that has the toon now.

Sadly, in these cases, there isn't really anything to do.

The scammer got control of the wallet that had the naked in it. Accepted the offer, then transferred out right away. The person who has it just had an offer in on it, and probably many others.


[23-May-22 01:54 PM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
@eruiz9191 there is still 3.xx eth in the wallet?

Basic TOON Guidelines (how to be a good toon)

1. Always have fun
2. Always support your fellow toonz
3. Never sell your toonz!
4. If you have to sell your toon, do it the right way (don’t torch the place on your way out)
5. Share your love of toonz with others
6. Be cool
7. Don’t shill ANYTHING in general, ever
8. No FUD!!! 

Follow these 8 simple guidelines for maximum toonage

yeah. Same thing happened before. Gold/robot explode up...pulls the rest of the cololection with them. As collection raises, super rares will  make another big push. If you want something with a rare trait, act now, or forever look at it in someone else's wallet.

You must not have been watching. Over 100 days of consistent growth.

Of course the paper posse will come out as they always do, but the true holders are here, and know the winners are the long term holders.

We'll let them take their little profits, and we will just keep moving forward!

If you are smart enough to own a toon, and confident enough to not even have it listed, you have found your home!

No fee private sales are huge. Used to do them all the time on opensea. I lost 2.6 eth on a deal when I happened to be selling an ape at the EXACT MOMENT they changed their policy with NO WARNING, and hit me for 2.5% of the sale. Needless to say, that sucked ass.

Seriosly toonz, we really need to cut the wallet to wallet stuff, the open discussion of trades in general, etc. As is being hinted at, we are now a target. We must act accordingly. If for the best of the culture of the project, and for the security of its members.

We have a room, #🛒┃marketplace that is designed for these discussions, and is limited to holders...so at least we arent worried about random people attacking us. I am not saying this to get anyone in a panic, more the opposite. We have the strength of community to make sure we do everything possible to limit our fellow toonz from running into issues. Options are private sale in Opensea or Looksrare. @hoolz said Coinbase NFT has free private sales, but I have yet to look into it.

Great value around the floor, unless you see a rare trait your absolutely love.

Toonz is a VERY aesthetic driven project.

Truly just find one you love, toon in, then toon out

once you've tooned in, just toon out everything else. Who cares what a VERY SMALL % of the 3800 owners do. Only becomes an issue when we make it an issue. True OG's who have been here have already seen this pattern over and over.

Having a few Debbie downers mixed into the same Degen toonz chat doesn't mean it's down.

We can't stop them from being them, but they can't stop us from being us.

So eventually they leave, and we move on.

Toon in, then toon out the noise.

The price today only matters if you are selling today.

Nothing changed with the project from yesterday to today other than a flood of meme projects sucking up some liquidity.

If you're tooned in, just chill out, and toon out the noise.

Whole damn talk in here tonight is FP.

Have faith for more than 24 hours toonz.

It's holders only


[26-May-22 02:37 PM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
Didn't know that. @Watts 🏴 what do you guys think?

We had the big talk about security, but the #🛒┃marketplace is viewable by non holders. This just tells the non holder who to target.

@BaderAsad.eth @princelail.eth @Joel Contartese i know you guys are busy, but the security of the community is priority nunber one.

It takes 10 seconds to close this loop.

We just had ANOTHER holder targeted by a scam earlier.

Can one of you please take a moment to login, and help secure the community?

This goes hand in hand with the discussion we started the space with Tuesday.

Thanks in advance for taking care of this!

Ask yourself why after the spaces last night, and the drop in a week, would it drop? Does anyone have motivation to do something like that?

It only took the sacrifice of a few toonz today to cause a panic and bring out the Kevins.

They want your toonz! They want em cheap.

Not sure. A full set in BAYC world is cool, but doesnt bring a huge premium, unless already on a rare asset.


[27-May-22 05:30 AM] TipOfTheSpear.nft#1424
I think nthe long play there is keeping the dyamite, and the unexploded asset, and that gives a new collector down the line the option, where as just going ahead and exploding it takes away the options
