you can set up many addresses or even reboot it to a new passphrase so if you fuck it up, you can "reset" it


[28-Feb-22 03:11 PM] Sigyn#0001
best thing to do but it requires a bit of eth, use 2 addresses, buy with one, send it to the second one. With the second one, never do any tx let it do the first one. If you screw yourself by approving a scammy shit, only the address who did the tx is at risk, not the entire ledger addresses. It will cost transfer fees tho but its safer

@BaderAsad.eth  by the way just a lil thing, my BF owns a project with a token, its a guild involved in p2e, many of our members followed us and bought a captain hat (as the guild theme is pirate) and we bought a nftworld land to build our own game. You got yourself an entire guild trying to ape in to get a captain hat 😄 nothing to do, nothing asked, just mentionning as its quite cool and fun ^^

I think people really need education on the crypto sphere but especially in nfts. 
Nfts should be a hobbie for people who already made it into crypto 
Or investors who have the liquidity.

People "needing" liquidity and sell should not be a thing. 
Crypto and nfts are risky AF too many people are "playing" with money they actually need irl which is the stupidiest move you can make in any markets and trading.

We really need education for these peeps. I saw too many loaning money to join the space its utterly stupid and so fucking dangerous.
All money as of now injected into crypto must be money you dont need, money you can consider lost. Otherwise, you are just at risk, in the "rekt" waiting room.

Im considering putting up a website to educate people, just not sure people are smart enough to educate first ....

what I fucking **love** about nfts is the big fuckers from tradi art market that only gets popular and sold because they know someone that know someone (believe me I know, my grand-father is a known painter) are getting pushed away from the crypto space. Literally there is no real big artists in tradi art market that made it into the crypto space and all "known names" including brands fades away faster than anything else. These people are cancer selling shit for millions and seems unable to make a name in **our** space - and this, I **love** it

guys, you have no idea what the project will be once people notice it might go on nftworld. People are dumping sandbox and decentraland for ntfworld. The WP is long and a bit complicated for many but you must believe if I tell you its **huge** and extremely bullish for the project

im not kidding, ITS HUGE , I was planning myself to buy one and build a thing on it


[28-Feb-22 08:01 PM] Sigyn#0001
nftworld is maybe expensive but still very undervalued / overlooked considering what is built there and the fact that what can be build is literally limitless. The size of the land itself is 1 trillion bigger than decentraland or sandbox. Not laggy, easy to build on, world$ token etc... omg

it means your toonz are not art only anymore but an asset that could potentially be used in nftworld (its like sandbox but 100000x better / usefull / bullish) and the team could even make a game that reward with $world or $toonz

learn the tech, study a lot, research a lot, inspect projects, invest wait, seat on your hands, make money 😛 no need of loto


[01-Mar-22 02:37 AM] Sigyn#0001
by learning the tech first. Im giving you the best thing I personnaly use to invest into a project. Im asking question to myself while im seraching :

- is it decentralized ?
- is it innovative / new ? If so, how far they are into the development, if not, are they doing better than others doing this ?
- Am I gonna use this token / the protocol ? 
- Is it on a chain that already proved itself (when I want to play it safe)
- I check scalability / interoperability
- Is it audited ? 


All these terms are "must know" if you want to search good. I got into LUNA around 1$
I got into ATOM under 
I got into AKASH at 0.8 I think
and so on for this last 12 months only. 

This method works. I dont touch tokens / protocols that can be hyped I dont invest to "trade" I invest where the tech interest me and I never invest where shit is not decentralized, dont build anything or taking forever, are not doing something inovative etc...

I have something on my side tho, my BF is a blockchain dev, it helps to know what direction to take to learn more. I keep learning, I keep asking questions and at some point you just dont know what you need to learn next its hard to guess by ourselves, here comes the importance of having developpers around you 🙂

I dont trust stable. I did for a time with UST on terra but not anymore, too much leverage on too many plateform and I fear the depeg. Tether is risky AF they can freeze your assets even tho they arent on CEX, same for USDC. Stables as of now are all but safe

look at the usdc contract. They can freeze it even outside CEX. And... they work with WEF....

its not about bann, they can control it and freeze it. If a smart contract allows owners to freeze remotely your assets, its super fucking red flag

I saw lands going for 50 up to 100 eth that are fully built its insane and no one is watching this coming. NFTWORLD just killed other metaverse and is 100% decentralized. YOu own your own server so no one can ever unplug your world and the size of the world is like 1 trillion bigger than other metaverse

you clearly have no idea sorry I could explain why but you wont mind what Ill try to explain so I wont bother. the framework of minecraft 1.7 (open source) allows anyone to use the plateform without the lag. You dont need a powerful device to run it - this alone compared to any big 3d design changes everything. Graphic card are not yet there 

There is no risk when signing a contract because you dont spend gas therefore you dont interact with a smart contract therefore you dont allow anything.... come on. Thats basic.


[01-Mar-22 10:26 PM] Sigyn#0001
people dont care about the look but the utility of stuff built on metaverse. Let say you have a full immersive superb 3d but cannot build anything ? and have lags all the time .  

big fat projects, whales and investors are buying nftworld for a reason. I'll make the assumption (without any bad thoughts) that you are clearly recent into the crypto space because when I compare 3d games and pixeled one, we can clearly see where the money goes. People want decentralization, open worlds, free to build whatever they want without limits. your project isnt in that field.

4- Unity is used by 90% of games nothing new here
5- Where is the WP ? none on their website which isnt serious for a project
6- Why did you put so much emojis to you own post ? 
7- NFTWORLDS has so much value that even microsoft is gonna deal with them to not loose their current players, currently dealing to open the 1.8 framwork to nftworld
8- You dont know the game industry or you would know that minecraft is one of the most played game in history online

no, institutions push the sell buttons to fear those who dont understand the market to sell / to get out of their wallet to come back to CEX to play with them. Crypto isnt the shitcoin called dollar ^^

no. thats a legend 🤣 there is few % of cryptos being in CEX. more than 90% are outside exchanges


[02-Mar-22 04:00 PM] Sigyn#0001
the biggest problem of CEX is they lost half of their volume because people are now outside trading using defi and not their plateform - CEX are super illiquid now - so no, most crypto is absolutely not traded there

[02-Mar-22 04:02 PM] Sigyn#0001
I think for BTC its like 5% being in CEX - thats why order books are empty, thats why you see big dump which are actually trap for people to come back and sell out of fear (but that works with ignorants only)

[02-Mar-22 04:07 PM] Sigyn#0001
the institutions are very shitty 🤣 they truly play with those who dont try to get these datas but their manipulation is so short term that it doesnt matter at all. When you zoom out, its been a while BTC did not even touch a bear its still an uptrend in daily/monthly / yearly but too many people look at it on a very idiotic short time frame such a 1h / 4h

years of learning / observing - getting btc / eth -  stagnation - met my man (dev blockchain) - he taught me way more than I could have by myself - smart investment started and kept being good until now 🙂 For the last 12 months success resides in :
- Luna bought around 1$
- Atom at pretty much the same price (dont recall exactly)
- Secret network and akash at the launch too 
- big profit out of few p2e games such as axie (around 150k)
- pegaxy (between 3 and 400k) 
- cryptoraiders (still holding it all nfts and tokens included with big gains but no TP for now)

I keep offering a bit under floor considering how cheap/broke they are, I would have thought they would accept faster than that 🤣


[02-Mar-22 06:11 PM] Sigyn#0001
HOLY fuck... people are brainless.... one bid and got the toon for almost 0.44 and is selling now for 0.49. He makes literally no profit (5$ ? ) if you take the fees out

Im in a crypto game called "cryptoraiders" (solid game) some influencers bought a shit load of the token , started to shill, it went from 4 to 15$ in few days. Then oh ? guess what ? they dumped on their own people following them. piece of shit if you ask me. and their followers doesnt even realize what they did

I busted them because they doxxed their wallet going few months back in their feeds (twitter) and saw what they did. Since, I just trust none of them. they arent there for projects, they arent there to support good stuff, they are only there to make money on their followers back.

I got one this morning and it was a cheap fucking big discount. **rank 34 - 2.5** 
I would have consider this FUD but the dude minted it so nice profit for him but a bit idiotic to sell that low imo

is the fact we got 70 BAYC and 260 blue chip holders here look typical ? 

Your question is tho :pepenoice:

Indeed. They proposed the vote so fast , responding to some people worrying about it in like 2 days ? SO much respect deserved for them. Thats why Im mad at that man (even tho I should be a tiny bit less wild in my words) He did not even check the holders chat to see the proposition.

they will sell off just after the giveaway 😉


[04-Mar-22 03:16 PM] Sigyn#0001
its actually good that these people are still selling cheap because this way, **we are getting rid of them**.
They will keep doing this until they are toonz-less so no, lets not push that moment for later, we need them out now and the quickest possible as they arent useful for the gang 😉

indeed but there is 2 kind. 
The first being the smart investor that seat on his hands for a while and watch the datas and volumes and act at a precise moment. 
Then there is the other one. No experiences, no knowledges whatsoever that often sell for idiotic reason like no eth left for 3 other projects to mint / buy etc... scare of something (their own shadow 😄 jk ) and we need them out there is still too many

I think tho we need asap ipfs. Thats something that matters for a loooooot of people. If I did not check it was only postponed due to *Idontrememberwhatissue* I would have never buy in - thats something we urgently needs cause many people arent checking any news from the project and IP is a very very very important thing for ivnestors / collectors

So after trying 10 thousands extensions and websites I came accross twitter picker for retweeter.

Probably it’s too big to miss it if he has access to where I have access (well, where my BF has access to be precise)

Don’t you like to know something is big ? I personally do and I don’t think it will be disclosed in a long time 🙂

I had to tell some people cause yesterday I got super bad energies from 1 or 2 peeps here getting a bit disrespectful because they were mad at me telling peeps to delist and wait for the announcement. No idea why, maybe they did not like the tease or just did not believe me but it was not nice at all I felt bad for an hour

yes, the land size is 1 trillion bigger than any other metaverse and what can be built is limitless. they can literally build : 
- a game
- a city (even many)
- a casino
- a poker place
- even a strip club if they want to 😄 (I know a project who are gonna do it )

Ohhh well I have my own opinion. Nfts should be bought only when you made it into crypto (for safety) and so, people shouldn’t need this money. Imagine if only people who made it in crypto would be in nfts. Only good project would rise and paper hands would not be a thing ^^

nfts are a gamble even a great team with a great roadmap can fail. even obvious scam can succeed . If people had the crypto / blockchain knowledges there would not be that many.

big ROI cannot be sustainable (see axie or pegaxy) but you can suck the game's blood and leave once the noobs fomo in it 🤣

if the price is still up, you better get out - I would

uh, yeah 😄


[06-Mar-22 07:37 PM] Sigyn#0001
I cant as the server is closed we cannot let more people in before we truly start. we will try to cap the members to 10k  as the meaning of doing it is to have something cool for the long run to make some money and not handling toomuch people - its very hard to manage a project with so much people ignoring the basics 😄

nop


[06-Mar-22 07:38 PM] Sigyn#0001
even our members are not super aware of what we are building - we were a tokenized guild at first and thought it would be safer to rely on ourselves in our own game than investing in projects that cannot last because mishandled

Im watching if : 
- its decentralized
- if its new / innovative
- If its not, trying to see if a project did better 
- if it is, trying to see if it can succeed 
- the blockchain its built on 
- If I will use the project

not at the moment. My bag is very diversified and its energy consumming to do all that research on new projects


[06-Mar-22 07:54 PM] Sigyn#0001
on the long run (count years here) ATOM from the cosmos ecosystem is huge huge huge


[06-Mar-22 07:55 PM] Sigyn#0001
its the most complex blockchain I have ever seen in my life. And the possibilities it offers are just demential I cant explain the whole ecosystem in few lines. Its basically impossible.


[06-Mar-22 07:56 PM] Sigyn#0001
think about cosmos being the bridges between all kind of things in the blockchain + decentralized  which NO blockchain have succeed as of now


[06-Mar-22 07:58 PM] Sigyn#0001
there is 4 competitor :
Solana : the chain is built with cosmos SDK 😄 but the blockchain they built is - at its current state - not safe 
Avalanche : super centralized
Polka : centralized too as projects around cannot work without DOT so , that causes issues
Cosmos : the scalability might be an issue in the future but knowing how the team works, I would bet they win the race


[06-Mar-22 07:58 PM] Sigyn#0001
indeed.


[06-Mar-22 07:59 PM] Sigyn#0001
cosmos ecosystem


[06-Mar-22 07:59 PM] Sigyn#0001
its a blockchain ....


[06-Mar-22 08:00 PM] Sigyn#0001
and there is stargaze there for marketplace that makes the bridges between all blockchain which is quite dope


[06-Mar-22 08:01 PM] Sigyn#0001
the best would be the cosmos WP honestly but good luck, it will take you few weeks to understand it all. very very complexe

its not a stable coin only 😄 but as an OG LUNAtiks bought around 1$ish luna , I sold out everything from terra. there is a big isssue on the UST because of all outside protocol using it as leverage - at some point, there could be a huge huge problem with the peg and anchor ust %


[06-Mar-22 08:08 PM] Sigyn#0001
I was shocked with the oracle issue and whales voting no to give the money back to the anchor users that have been rekt by it..... and lets not even talk about the centralization ORION and other shit fuckers have succeed to take over


[06-Mar-22 08:08 PM] Sigyn#0001
there is literally few VC's that have now a dangerous vote power on terra.


[06-Mar-22 08:09 PM] Sigyn#0001
I tried to raise the issue on the governance website but even tho everyone were worried, no one saw any possibilities to fix it as its a problem that is hard to fix - I got out short after (not only because of that )


[06-Mar-22 08:10 PM] Sigyn#0001
no i just spent and spend and will spend a lot of time learning ^^


[06-Mar-22 08:23 PM] Sigyn#0001
I know what is happening there thats why. We are working with an ukrainian company. They want to leave and wait outside the county but the gov force them to stay


[06-Mar-22 08:24 PM] Sigyn#0001
and also they forbid their people to use crypto then few days later opened a wallet to receive some...

I have sent thousands of $ to some people in the philippines that I know because they played for me in some p2e games


[06-Mar-22 08:28 PM] Sigyn#0001
With the money they went into the streets - poor neighborhood - and gave a shit load of food, vitamines, clothes, school supplies, toys for kids etc.... and at least there, I can get actual videos and pictures of the good it made on the people directly 🙂


[06-Mar-22 08:29 PM] Sigyn#0001

There is a good advice a BAYC gave yesterday on twitter. 
And its not even only working for nfts even tho he was talking about nfts only. 
"**Buy during the winter what you are gonna trade during the summer**"
I mean, thats literally how it works for the whole crypto space. 

People forget to zoom out, like for the BTC. They keep watching on idiotic small restrictive time frame.
Hours, Days, 1 week. And when actually zoom out, you see the thing quite bigger than this idioctic tiny timeframe that literally
Means nothing in any kind of market. 

Anyone doing it for toonz - understand it - knows its bullish. 
But patience is the key and you might need to wait few weeks minimum and even months
before recolting the fruits of this amazing project. 

*Keep learning, I do to*

stay vigilant nonetheless with "approval" and in case of any doubts that you might have approved something you dont trust, often go check and use revoke.cash


[08-Mar-22 04:33 PM] Sigyn#0001
to revoke approvals


[08-Mar-22 04:35 PM] Sigyn#0001
if you want to play it safe, buy with one address, send it to another address and dont use the second one to make any transactions. it cost gas of course but its very safe. when you compromise an address, its not the entire ledger that is (if it involves a bad approval) but only the address you used to make this approval


[08-Mar-22 04:37 PM] Sigyn#0001
yes in 2 conditions : 
- giving your passphrase
- making a bad approval to a smart contract that has a code allowing it to withdraw all you got on the address you compromised

[08-Mar-22 04:39 PM] Sigyn#0001
the thing is, thats somehow all devs of the world fault because there is no line code that allows a precise amount to be transactionned. INstead, all smart contract are coded to ask for an "approval all" (unlimited amount) hopefull in the future it will change

I heard an irish dude lost his HDD when I was 20ish and had BTC on it (passphrase) he bought for few dollars and worth at that time 300$ per BTC (he ahd a lot) and commited suicide. I started there wondering about the tech, bought some, lost it (passphrase thingy 🤣🤣🤣 like sooo many) and kept on eye on it without investing until eth where I got in early , kept, made some profit, got out, came back in and this for a while until trying to learn a lot more from the tech itself the "hows" of everything, got interested by the fact btc was using the military grade encryption stuff like that and bought few things here and there. Lucky enough always in profit. Then the leverage shit got me, I lost a lot, I made back a lot until I got this was cancer and stepped out for good out of leverage. Kept learning but full stagnation as I did not know what to learn and then I met my blockchain dev BF who taught me everything I know (and I keep learning everyday) thats pretty much the story ^^

Because of the choice of sha 256 I always had this theory that a group of people close to the elite built BTC to give us a weapon that might be very useful for us to use against something bad - because there was another encryption back then that could have been used and was discovered later as compromised and easily « hacked » by govs if they wanted to. only a theory but now that they show how scared they are of crypto and want to force us into CBDC shit to control us fully im even more sure the theory is correct

when you get scammed / hacked, there is no time to withdraw it one by one, its a line of code that does it. It takes out everything

when you create an ETH wallet on metamask. How come do you think metamask doesnt ask you for your passphrase each time you open it ?


[08-Mar-22 06:37 PM] Sigyn#0001
because its locally saved

1 for sure, maybe 2

ok lets check the second one... praying its not also an hack


[08-Mar-22 07:02 PM] Sigyn#0001
the second one has literally zero allowances that are at risk


[08-Mar-22 07:02 PM] Sigyn#0001
probably yes


[08-Mar-22 07:02 PM] Sigyn#0001
or allow a bad approve

yes "no allowances" means the smart contract has zero autorizhation


[08-Mar-22 07:06 PM] Sigyn#0001
you can defitnitely mint something from a scam project and give an approval for all without knowing the code inside the contract will be able to drain your wallet

and don’t buy the NANO S you can only use like 2 or 3 blockchain max with it - nano X is bigger - and if you wonder why not a trezor which is cheaper the reason is : it’s hackable in 2 minutes (physically)

I would like to make an official complaint. I hereby blame @CryptologistG ...

Toonz have created a new kind of addiction 

That addiction is harder than the strongest cocaine 

Many of us try to toonz-rehab. Basically trying to not look at the collection at all and focus on those we already hold.

In our anon group it wasn’t recommended to avoid the sale bot (from here or Twitter)

And everyday we see him buying badass bitch toonz . And I have a theory...

**This is a fucking conspiracy**

Devs hired him to make us feel in need of another toonz-shot every-fuxking-day and we keep falling again and again.

I hereby ask he gets put in jail until full recovery of the addict community.

**please and thank you**

The roadmap is the issue


[08-Mar-22 10:22 PM] Sigyn#0001
The roadmap is empty - I tried to help them and give them some tips - roadmap is the issue for anyone watching their project even tho the art is SO BEAUTIFUL


[08-Mar-22 10:24 PM] Sigyn#0001
Except it won’t ever happen if they don’t sell out if they don’t get a publisher and it will take so much time. That’s why the roadmap is too empty there is nothing else with too much “if” for the only thing planned and too much time to wait to see any of this becoming real 🙂

[09-Mar-22 03:14 PM] Sigyn#0001
its limitless literally. and 100% decentralized. Each owner has its own server
- We can build a game
- a casino
- a poker 
- a strip club 😄
- a marketplace
- the size of the land is 1 trillion bigger than any other
- no one has a hand on it (no unplugged from anyone) 
- its less laggy than any other plateform

I got one too and my bf is developping a game on it. We played for fun and its so cool. 
As of now we all need a minecraft pass tho but its 20$ 
In the future, they intend to build something that allows people to join without the pass


[09-Mar-22 03:17 PM] Sigyn#0001

its quite fast knowing all they build for us as an example

if toonz do something a bit lighter / smaller, it can take a way less time

Legit / not lazy devs don’t dev on this shit

Those who dev there do it to be seen quick and most are scams


[09-Mar-22 07:00 PM] Sigyn#0001
and since BSC users are often new in the space they buy easily - also why these shitty devs codes there 😉

Reverted means you did not buy man


[09-Mar-22 07:08 PM] Sigyn#0001
probably because someone was buying it too in the same time and got faster than u


[09-Mar-22 07:09 PM] Sigyn#0001

let’s be clear , the FED is owned by elite literally like the ECB , they screwed us over for decades and now they know it will fall at some point. CBDC is like a chain you will put yourself around your nake like a slave if you accept to use it or promote it . No transparency no decentralization the same people will have full control over it. And what will happen then ? When you see they froze BINANCE account assets from Canadian truckers when you see they froze Russians citizens too ? Well guys if don’t comply to anything you will know what black mirror tv show looks like.

rate hikes = instutions will buy dollars and might dump cryptos (short term). Effect on nfts ? at this time no one can clearly predict anything. With eth down, many see it as an opportunity to buy nfts. But others does when it pumps too. 
95% of nfts disappearing well, it has always been the case so nothing new under the sun ^^

but what makes people want one ? its quite horrible (for my own taste)


[11-Mar-22 07:26 PM] Sigyn#0001
ok this I get it but people really seems to buy less on how the art looks like


[11-Mar-22 07:26 PM] Sigyn#0001

[11-Mar-22 07:28 PM] Sigyn#0001
what they do about their money is clearly not interesting to me, what does interest me tho is whats the idea of buying some nfts that clearly looks like pretty much nothing


[11-Mar-22 07:28 PM] Sigyn#0001
if it is pure investements based on hype

oh thats clear yeah


[11-Mar-22 07:31 PM] Sigyn#0001
as the grand daughter of a kinda  known painter, the thing about buying because the man is known is something I wont ever understand. and its for me a huge problem in art as of today (traditional art) with the great example of this artist putting a banana on a wall and calling it art, selling his shit only based on the name he succeed to make because of the friends he had.


[11-Mar-22 07:32 PM] Sigyn#0001
but of course, some known artists are superb even tho some art can not be liked, its still art nonetheless


[11-Mar-22 07:32 PM] Sigyn#0001
reputation is not ^^


[11-Mar-22 07:34 PM] Sigyn#0001
I agree completely, my point was the reputation made for artists that worth pretty much nothing as of today if you see closely what is being popular / sold in the tradi market (I cant speak about nfts VS known artist Im not enough into nfts to know about it)


[11-Mar-22 07:35 PM] Sigyn#0001
but so, if you own one, is it because of the artist , the art or the speculation ? im very curious to know

[12-Mar-22 03:51 PM] Sigyn#0001
well here is what is happening. There was a rich whale a long time ago who had a lot of atom. His wallet was capped for any airdrop to 50k so he divided into many wallets. He never really touched it and kept staking. A long time after, JUNO was announced then launched. He got a huge amount of JUNO airdrop. (again, keep in mind airdrops and protocols were not even announced when he set up his wallet. 

Now, a mob a jealous cheap fucks made a proposition to **take away** all JUNO he received on his wallets. "thats not fair" is the reason. They made up some excuses that arent verified and backed with zero proof such as it was on purpose (which cannot be since JUNO wasnt even announced at that time....) such as creating a lot of slippage selling his junos on dex's (which isnt prooved by any proofs) 

DAO is a good thing, I get involved a lot in all chains / projects I have invested in. But the cheap jealous fucks are now opening a door if this prop passes that allows a chain to simply steal people's money so tomorrow we could see a worst prop like "you have too much power vote lets get your money" ... The only real concerns would be that whale having too much vote power indeed but ffs thats his money. Not his fault wallets are capped and this is something that has always been going on in crypto. I cant believe they dared proposing such a thing.... thats the exact definition of communist imo. Im disgust.

[12-Mar-22 03:55 PM] Sigyn#0001
and never ever happened in crypto. I hope this wont pass. Whales will leave asap and kill the token for sure.... me included


[12-Mar-22 03:57 PM] Sigyn#0001
I see this as poor fucks noob into crypto joining as a mob to attack the whales. it wont end up well


[12-Mar-22 04:16 PM] Sigyn#0001
Maybe but he's still not breaking any rules


[12-Mar-22 04:18 PM] Sigyn#0001
the concern should be his vote power. A prop could have been made about that. Maybe splitting dividing by 4 or 5 his vote power. Other than that, he did nothing wrong and whales will leave the ship anyway. With or without the prop going through because the risk of a mob taking your money away without consent is just a too big risk to take. I just unstaked 5 min ago. They will celebrate their token whales freee at 1$ 🤣


[12-Mar-22 04:19 PM] Sigyn#0001
that prop has literally the power to annihilate the whole project.


[12-Mar-22 04:21 PM] Sigyn#0001
but many did play the airdrop like in all projects in all chains - its just that he had the problem to be super rich and so he is targetted. I mean, I get the issue, but voting to take his money out ? what in the actual fuck, thats china communism under steroids lol

{Reactions}
💯 

[12-Mar-22 04:22 PM] Sigyn#0001
and he did not dump, thats something to take into consideration. Instead he kept staking


[12-Mar-22 04:22 PM] Sigyn#0001
he is supporting the protocol so far


[12-Mar-22 04:24 PM] Sigyn#0001
but its a loss in any case. 
if it goes through, he will dump what he has left
whales will follow 
if it doesnt go through , whales and him included will not take the risk to stay on a chain where cheaps fuckers can vote to take your money away. I can be wrong but I think thats simply the end of Juno.


[12-Mar-22 04:26 PM] Sigyn#0001
its not like he is playing the market - here its more a question (imo) of core principles. No one should ever be able to steal from you just because you made too much money. Thats probably why no one ever made such prop on any blockchain since the very creation of BTC


[12-Mar-22 04:29 PM] Sigyn#0001
we cannot agree on everything 😄 But imagine someone make a prop saying Cryptologist has too much toonz and should get nothing [put anything here that would be given per toonz from the project] because he has too much. The core of this is the same even is the situation differs ^^


[12-Mar-22 04:30 PM] Sigyn#0001
but in that case, why him only ? only because he has an amount that makes people jealous... the dude who staked 100 atom on 100 wallet, no one is going after him or them ^^


[12-Mar-22 04:31 PM] Sigyn#0001
im exagerating a lot but the core of the problem stay the same. Little ones jealous of big ones wanting to punish them for having less


[12-Mar-22 04:31 PM] Sigyn#0001
Im anti elite anti govs and banks but not anti rich 😉


[12-Mar-22 04:33 PM] Sigyn#0001
I understand but that dude supported the protocol, did not unstake after gettting his airdrop.


[12-Mar-22 04:33 PM] Sigyn#0001
and what he did was done by millions of people


[12-Mar-22 04:33 PM] Sigyn#0001
the only difference is, he is richer so he is the target


[12-Mar-22 04:41 PM] Sigyn#0001
It was an hypothetical example made up with someone we know here to demonstrate a risk of a proposal on Juno network

Right now investing is super hard. Many friends asked me where to put funds . The market is so hesitating I personally have like 71k of matic that are sleeping without generating any money but safer than investing right now . staying in ETH is also investing , just safer and longer ^^

pegaxy had a great idea. But here was an economic issue (mint/burn mechanism) I took the bet because if the burn mechanisms planned into their WP were implemented fast, the game could have had a lifespan of at least 2 years. They did not because they are like many others, amateurs. So I grew a huge stable, keep an eye on the burn/mint daily, on all datas such as sales / prices / market condition etc.... and sold it all at ath when I saw the first sign of the decline. Everyone stayed because they "hoped" .
I got out with 350k$ made on less than 2 months 😏

[13-Mar-22 05:45 PM] Sigyn#0001
metasoccer - careful tho, there is ALWAYS the risk 
1. the team make a mistake
2. burn mechanism are not implemented fast enough

but other than that, besides my future own game + my bf future game I see no alpha so far and I keep watching daily


[13-Mar-22 05:45 PM] Sigyn#0001
investment on pegaxy to start was 20k or so


[13-Mar-22 05:46 PM] Sigyn#0001
yeah but there is not many good p2e out there


[13-Mar-22 05:47 PM] Sigyn#0001
and even great ones can be fucked up by a team that gets a too high egos and too much irl friends they want to help out getting money unfairly out of the game 😉


[13-Mar-22 05:47 PM] Sigyn#0001
I wont name it but there is one that had the greatest economic modele I have ever seen

follow your guts but if the loss is okay for you, try to get whats left to get that how I operate at least


[13-Mar-22 05:53 PM] Sigyn#0001
this is the list of where you can find games as of now : 

- eth - good but expensive
- polygon - I trust this chain and has the support of vitalik
- Avax - good but dangerous because of the huge centralization 
- Immutable - good but ... some centralization, miss a bit of transparency and not stress-tested so dangerous until some good hackaton goes there
- BSC - never touch it its the one to skip no matter what

there is few others but my knowledge is not good enough

Centralization means a team can rekt the chain if a gov ask and as of now I would be fuxking scared to be in any chain that can be pressured by any state

Centralization  also means (and many do not know which is hilarious) if you have some USDT or USDC anywhere even on your ledger - both these entities can forever freeze your assets remotely 😂

No but if the gov goes and ask to turn off the chain it won’t be difficult to force them

ledger is just the host of my passphrase


[14-Mar-22 04:14 PM] Sigyn#0001
its your passphrase that are holding your cryptos not the hardware. the ledgers are only the thing that allows you to use cryptos safely


[14-Mar-22 04:15 PM] Sigyn#0001
allow to execute transaction without puting your passphrase in danger

[17-Mar-22 05:23 PM] Sigyn#0001
imagine all the illegale stuff they must do... receiving maybe hundreds of eth as bribe to verify some collection. Nothing would surprise me ever from them after all the manipulation / inside trading they have been busted for a year or so ago

when it start to take momentum for pump we have always a bunch of idiots cutting stupidly the floor - I dont like that either but more because I have an inversion for stupidness. Now what we all need to remember is at some point, we will have getting rid of all these peeps. So better to see them kicking themselves out **now** becaue obviously when the project will reach the state it deserves we dont want them to profit out of it we want the strong members composing the gang to profit out of it. 
So let them undercut over and again, at the end, we will profit from it. Best thing that can happen is them leaving we dont want them near when toonz will be at few eth floor 😉

They don’t remotely take control of your metamask - they get control of your ETH adress / passphrase


[17-Mar-22 10:25 PM] Sigyn#0001
no, they have full control of your wallet


[17-Mar-22 10:26 PM] Sigyn#0001
nothing you can do with metamask


[17-Mar-22 10:26 PM] Sigyn#0001

oh ok so you are mistaken here, allow me to explain


[20-Mar-22 05:06 PM] Sigyn#0001
the builders are the team hired to build worlds and games using nftworlds. 
These teams are hired by land's owners. 
Not owners of lands / games .


[20-Mar-22 05:06 PM] Sigyn#0001
its to offer a safe place to get some peeps working on our lands that are verified by nftworlds team.

well Im co-leading a game built there, (my man is the dev and project owner) he speaks regularly with the core team and never heard of owners getting doxxed (neither am I as an owner too )


[20-Mar-22 05:10 PM] Sigyn#0001
but its cool they do verify the team to built anything .- I felt safe hiring one


[20-Mar-22 05:10 PM] Sigyn#0001

we cannot built customized characters on nftworlds so we are just making a funny pixelised collection as the symbols of the ingame character


[20-Mar-22 05:29 PM] Sigyn#0001
yeah


[20-Mar-22 05:29 PM] Sigyn#0001

[20-Mar-22 05:31 PM] Sigyn#0001
we want people to be able to test the game before launching the nft


[20-Mar-22 05:31 PM] Sigyn#0001
for them to know what they are buying instead of buying without knowing what you are gonna get


[20-Mar-22 05:31 PM] Sigyn#0001
yes few times


[20-Mar-22 05:33 PM] Sigyn#0001
thing is, nftworlds use minecraft framework so every game are limited to the main character. You can customize it a lil bit like colors or clothes but not making a bird for example (except non player chars) so the nft representing the pooping bird is just the representation of the ingame characters but wont look the same as its impossible for now

ledger nano X if you want to use many chains - Nano S if you will stay on ETH 
also, never buy on secondary market these hardware - someone could have compromised them. Buy from official website (and check it is indeed the official website)

the greatest mistake in crypto is trying to predict the future. 
You can only analyze the past to understand the present. 

Right now we see the biggest range ever seen on BTC, if we break it, the pump could become extremely massive but as of now we are in a range. Not a bull, not a bear as some people like to think and say. We arent in a bear market, we are in a range with a lot of hesitation. Long term, if you zoom out (which amateurs never do) using a wider timeframe such as weekly / monthly we are still in an uptrend.

there is actually no need of 2 ledgers you just have to create a secondary eth address. When you get fucked by a scamm, the approval mistakely made is only possible from the compromised address, not the whole ledger as the passphrase is never hacked at all. its only approvals and perms you give that can fuck your ledger up. therefore, just create a secondary wallet using the same ledger is pretty much the same as using a second ledger 😉

[22-Mar-22 03:24 PM] Sigyn#0001
second ledger is useful to use it as an anon wallet - using your primary, using a mixer / anonymizer and send it to the second ledger. thats what I use my other ledgers for ^^

imagine, if they take like 20% of royalties, put in into a pool, take the pool reward, buy $wrld token, they can airdrop it to owners using the nftworlds land. it cost zero to them

having 1 land = accessing all tools from nftworlds including the faucet to reward peeps or airdroping their token to your users.
1 land can have "sub-land" (sub server) where you can add whatever you want. You can basically create 10 different game usnig 10 different places while owning only 1 land

well as an owner its up to you to create an economic modele - there is no lazy mode there ^^


[22-Mar-22 04:46 PM] Sigyn#0001
minecraft framework yes


[22-Mar-22 04:48 PM] Sigyn#0001
1 land is enough to build whatever you want / whatever you could have in mind. 
I dont get your second question "the amount of token we receive worth it" ? give it more context


[22-Mar-22 04:49 PM] Sigyn#0001
doesnt work like that. You cant "produce" token. You have to have a great game or else and the team could accept your project to use the token faucet. But if you have a good project, and have an idea of how an economic modele works, you dont need the faucet


[22-Mar-22 04:49 PM] Sigyn#0001
you generate money you buy $wrld, you use their system to airdrop it to players/owners


[22-Mar-22 04:50 PM] Sigyn#0001
in the future we wont need to buy minecraft


[22-Mar-22 04:50 PM] Sigyn#0001
they are currently building something that will allow people to join without it


[22-Mar-22 04:50 PM] Sigyn#0001
like a portal


[22-Mar-22 04:50 PM] Sigyn#0001
they are already on it


[22-Mar-22 04:51 PM] Sigyn#0001
they are building the actual "door" to bypass the very use of minecraft - using only the frameworks needed and thats all - cant explain more than that as its more complicated and I dont get it msyself 100% 😄


[22-Mar-22 04:53 PM] Sigyn#0001
every - whenever they want


[22-Mar-22 04:54 PM] Sigyn#0001
imagine this : 
I put into a pool 1 millions.
It generates let say 20% I can have few thousands to airdrop each month to owners


[22-Mar-22 04:55 PM] Sigyn#0001
if you generate money using a safe pool such as eth/btc or whatever
who cares about the value of $wrld token ? 
if you have 1000$ of apr made, its still 1000$ to redistribute


[22-Mar-22 04:55 PM] Sigyn#0001
no matter how many wrld token you buy with it


[22-Mar-22 04:56 PM] Sigyn#0001
and $wrld token is needed by all games there


[22-Mar-22 04:56 PM] Sigyn#0001
so land owners have to buy some to reward their players


[22-Mar-22 04:56 PM] Sigyn#0001
so there is demand


[22-Mar-22 04:57 PM] Sigyn#0001
its not thats only because you dont know how DeFi works


[22-Mar-22 04:57 PM] Sigyn#0001
the money stays in the pool man... so it keeps generating.... + the price of the safe assets you have in it that have more chance to go higher than lower if its safe assets such as eth and btc


[22-Mar-22 05:02 PM] Sigyn#0001
Pools need liquidity to avoid slippage so you get the fees from users swapping using the pool


[22-Mar-22 05:03 PM] Sigyn#0001
Check how much volume is made on a ETH/MATIC pool for example on sushiswap you will see how much money go through each day 😉


[22-Mar-22 05:04 PM] Sigyn#0001

I mean at some point if people keeps joining the crypto space with zero security « because a ledger is too expensive » at some point it’s also good to point out their very own fault (even tho of course I don’t wish this to anyone) if you want to gamble with security people need to take responsibility to loose

I got exit scammed once in my lifetime because I was not listening to someone - never happened again never got scammed and even with full security and ledgers I keep the fear close to never make a mistake leading to a scam of my wallet (rug can still happen but so far so good)


[23-Mar-22 04:10 AM] Sigyn#0001
But yeah the team is too nice and need to stop giving back what knowledge and 5min of someone’s time would have been enough to avoid a scam

you can also put it into a cylinder of a strong metal that can endure fire

there is something cool to protect it from your own death

but I cant remember the name of the protocol


[24-Mar-22 04:25 PM] Sigyn#0001
you give an approval to it to send the entire assets in your ledger if you dont give sign of life to the protocol every 6 months


[24-Mar-22 04:25 PM] Sigyn#0001
something like that


[24-Mar-22 04:26 PM] Sigyn#0001

they could make this cheaper tho. its quite expensive for such a simple thing despite the metal used

my feed doesnt look great atm. Its really great to have a toonz follow toonz to raid, to shill, to do spaces and have fun but it looks more like a "I want to grow my followers" more than anything else... like the last 10 posts I see are about getting followed. There is really no point of doing that just to have a big number of peeps following, you arent going to be a paid influencer or some type of things like that because you got a big numbers of friends. Post content with meaning and be interesting...

Watch « tree plant sings » you will be shocked . They don’t sing but someone created something to get their vibrations and electricity it’s just crazy. You touch them for example it makes a sound very special. And someone tried with 2 similar plants one GMO one natural . The GMO did not made sounds . Very strange

[25-Mar-22 02:02 AM] Sigyn#0001
please, do some serious research. learn the tech, learn crypto and learn the market


[25-Mar-22 02:02 AM] Sigyn#0001
then buy nfts from there, not before...

did I misunderstand you 😄 ? remember I am french so sometimes I misread stuff


[25-Mar-22 02:05 AM] Sigyn#0001
serious time frame would be few weeks / months.


[25-Mar-22 02:07 AM] Sigyn#0001
ohhh well, learn how the tech actually works. thats the great advise I can give 🙂 I guess you already know how to "read" the market so now you only need to understand the tech and how its market can differ from the tradi one I suppose


[25-Mar-22 02:07 AM] Sigyn#0001

main problem is, 80% of the floor is made of bots buying cheaper relisting higher since 2 weeks and those arent part of the server

THIS
People watch the project itself, the community and what is left on the market. 
rare ones are basically untouchable right now, with only few listed at reasonnable prices. 
thats why big boys are buying some everyday. 

i believe in the natural and organic growth toonz has and will keep on the long run 

Listen up to KING guys, he isnt KING for nothing

there is 40 robots listed and 25 gold. 
gold are cheap

total of 65 rare top nft on a 8888 collection. If that isnt speaking to their ears i dont no what will


[25-Mar-22 02:37 AM] Sigyn#0001
2.5 eth for a gold when there is only 65 rare available is stupidly cheap

scams are so widespread now that so much ignorance has spread too.. too much people joined with no care about security or the basics such as the tech itself especially in nfts... and all of that, I am 99% sure, is based on greed that push them to have this biased idea that they are playing in a safe lotery which crypto isnt nor nfts...

you want to know something scary that most ignore about USDC ?


[25-Mar-22 04:24 PM] Sigyn#0001
whatever the chain you use to have some it can be the wrapped one on polygon for that matter, USDC has a special little code for holders, giving them the ability to FREEZE remotly your usdc . It means that even if you have your usdc on another chain and in a ledger, they can just freeze it and already did in the past

Javascript exploit - wallets can be compromised


[27-Mar-22 04:10 AM] Sigyn#0001
Do you have a hot or cold wallet


[27-Mar-22 04:11 AM] Sigyn#0001
is a JavaScript malicious code exploit so obviously only hot wallet could be compromised in the worst scenario - update just in case

Awwww that’s so cute to have your toonz there ❤️


[27-Mar-22 04:16 AM] Sigyn#0001
from what I understand it doesn’t need to be crypto related to be at risk with the exploit


[27-Mar-22 04:16 AM] Sigyn#0001
Hopefully a wake up call to get a freaking hardware :Coffee_Pepe:

They will learn to dyor before investing . I know it’s rough to say that but at some point people need to understand a hardware wallet IS NOT optional

ToonsquadNFT story - well, to put it simply, I bought with a hot wallet and sent it to the ledger. 
there was a shitload of nice giveaways for minters holders
I opened a ticket to ask only they verify what I was saying about my hot wallet / ledger, to not disqualify me from cool giveaway. 
The mod was nice and all and asked the owner to take care of it by tagging him in the ticket.
48h past and the dude was ignoring the ticket. 
I tagged him too and wait few days more. 
Until someone just closed the ticket withtout warning, without explanation, without telling me anything (while my request was legit and normal).

I have proof


[29-Mar-22 01:24 AM] Sigyn#0001
The back story : well first I swept their floor and bring some degens with me and minted a shot load of it . I did with my hot wallet and sent to my ledger - they made multiple great giveaways including nfts worth few ETH. I asked them to take my ledger adress as the condition for these was to be monter and holder. I waited a week, admins were tagged in the ticket no one replied and someone closed it. So I left.


[29-Mar-22 01:26 AM] Sigyn#0001
they sent someone to talk to me. I was disregarded so never mind I just left and won’t comback but the dude said « big holders are gonna hunt where she holds to rekt the floor » if that’s not blackmail I don’t know what it is

Because they played it wrong on something with me which wasn’t a huge issue , I just left and put some at floor no undercut . But then, I got threaten by one of the team


[29-Mar-22 03:35 AM] Sigyn#0001
To send people to rekt the floor on projects I am which basically is degen toonz since I don’t play much in nfts as I’m more into crypto

[29-Mar-22 03:40 AM] Sigyn#0001
nothing big at the beginning. I asked them to add my address where my nfts are on the list of the minter that are eligible for all the giveaways they made since I minted with a hot wallet that wasnt eligible (since the nfts were just after sent to my cold walelt) so I opened a ticket, a mod reply and ask the team, after few days,nothing, so  I taged the team too, after few days later the just closed it without any explanation or anything so I left. I then sold some at floor - no undercut. then the CM tried to contact me sending dms to a degen fella acting like the intermediary of the conversation. I refused to talk with the CM so he got pissed and threaten to basically rekt the floor of projects I am in


[29-Mar-22 03:41 AM] Sigyn#0001
yes


[29-Mar-22 03:41 AM] Sigyn#0001

look I will tell you this one last time. Threatening to rekt degen tonz (even tho they cannot even do it) made me mad at them because I LOVE degenz. thats a direct threat directed to me using the project I love. So yes, indeed im mad. They would have not done that, i would have exit quietly. Now the collection is 7k I have listed 30. if 30 is menacing a whole project, there is more to fear than my listing. Also as a side note, I did not undercut the floor at first, a BAYC did. then I listed 0.01 under him which is barely nothing. Now you mad at me because you value them more than degen - nothing wrong with that, but I chose my side. If I did it into crypto, then nfts as a fun side to spend my profit, its not by playing with fire. they played with fire with me making a huge red flag for me, for anyone who thinks through it actually. Accept it.

go to revoke . cash and revoke approvals that has "allowance" for OpenSea


[29-Mar-22 07:26 PM] Sigyn#0001
be sure to check the little thing saying nft (the button)

[29-Mar-22 07:27 PM] Sigyn#0001
check if you see any "opensea allowance" if you have some, click on "revoke" button next to it


[29-Mar-22 07:27 PM] Sigyn#0001
it cost like 4$ of gas


[29-Mar-22 07:28 PM] Sigyn#0001
and will cost the same if you need to get the allowance back to list or else on OS


[29-Mar-22 07:28 PM] Sigyn#0001
but before the potential exploit is patched, its better to stay safe and out of any kind of allowance on OS


[29-Mar-22 07:32 PM] Sigyn#0001
yeah


[29-Mar-22 07:32 PM] Sigyn#0001
very welcome 🙂 ❤️


[29-Mar-22 07:32 PM] Sigyn#0001
the allowances you made for OpenSea


[29-Mar-22 07:38 PM] Sigyn#0001
Or you have allowances or you don’t lol use revoke . Cash


[29-Mar-22 07:38 PM] Sigyn#0001
it’s simpler than etherscan revoke


[29-Mar-22 07:39 PM] Sigyn#0001
It revokes approval


[29-Mar-22 09:22 PM] Sigyn#0001
I don’t see what vulnerability could be out there if assets aren’t at risk since only giving OS allowances can actually put anyone at risk. Very strange

Occasionally but I used to do much more trade in the past until I got above 500k then I stopped mostly to HODL and search projects to invest in long term

On a side note it’s good to trade Luna short term there is danger around the whole chain  that not many are experienced enough to detect

What’s the rank ?


[29-Mar-22 09:51 PM] Sigyn#0001
I know what volatility means , when you get your first hundred of thousands , 2 or 3% daily represent thousands of loss or profit from there you start to be less greedy and try to protect your assets more than trying to « make money » considering that I know my assets can be half tomorrow so better to stay modest enough as volatility can easily crash your bag as it did for me in June with the 7500 Luna lost on anchor


[29-Mar-22 09:52 PM] Sigyn#0001
Zoom out and try to protect your bag instead of trying to make money you will therefore make money. Also no need to invest in risky stuff - stick to safe cryptos strong cryptos and keep in mind revolutionary project are more a myth than reality. Oh and don’t listen to people online 99% actually know shit about the tech 😉

Ohhh that’s different 🤣 depends if degenqueen or sigyn investor speaks I suppose but I have 140k in toonz so


[01-Apr-22 10:41 PM] Sigyn#0001
I would buy 1 or 2 toonz but a majority of crypto (Btc and ETH only) if that was by investment bag for the first months of the year

People wants to much to discover the next x3000% while Btc and ETH are already giving so much and are so safer than everything else. Until you know the tech very well there is no reason to look at anything else

No one ever heard of feline
One core team bought one because feline owner bought a toonz and got friendly with him
Our community followed it and supported a project that liked toonz to do like our team
Feline with our toonz members  started to use the exact same scheme used here but there.
Feline got visibility and hype

1. They are here since almost a year 
And don’t have a cheap community with a 8eth floor 
2. They are cats
3. Premium not secondary zone 
4. They aren’t super busy these days their discord is less active then here so best time to propose it and get it 
5. We can’t afford to collab with second class - they are premium

minecraft have 1 base character that can be a lil bit customized but you cannot get more than the original shape so hard to get a replica of the toonz there

Many devs blockchain stated it (my man included) only maxis doesn’t see the treat. Mim with their magic money was already a treat . Anchor is treatening more than we might think


[04-Apr-22 01:04 AM] Sigyn#0001
no it’s technically true


[04-Apr-22 01:04 AM] Sigyn#0001

[04-Apr-22 01:06 AM] Sigyn#0001
They are leveraging Luna price on Btc and ethereum - their peg is at risk - MIM make the risk greater. Anchor 50% of the terra TVL !!!!


[04-Apr-22 01:06 AM] Sigyn#0001
50% of terra Tvl and do kwon wants to be the biggest btc wallet at some point

[04-Apr-22 01:09 AM] Sigyn#0001
Every degen are collateralizing themselves high risk big money MIM and many other protocol outside terra . Depegged happened already but the ecosystem wasn’t big at that time. Now imagine ... and again I’m a terra OG I left in December they are insane . Again, keep that in mind : ANCHOR represent 50% of terra tvl

On which everyone is leveraging high risk on both terra and ethereum using MIM


[04-Apr-22 01:13 AM] Sigyn#0001
I wish I could write it well myself


[04-Apr-22 01:16 AM] Sigyn#0001
I’ll try with simple word. 
People leverage high risk big money on 2 chains (terra and ethereum and probably cosmos now not sure) if they get liquidated ? If they are many ? They sell off UST - which is then minted selling Luna - which creates more liquidations which creates more minted UST. That’s the best I can write for this one but there is more and a lot more technical where I can not go myself to explain


[04-Apr-22 01:18 AM] Sigyn#0001
Now it goes into ethereum and now btc too.

I hired a young woman yesterday , à PH woman. She needed money to pay for her last semester at school. She asked me to loan her some . I said not but found something. I asked her to save all my 55 toonz pics put all in an excel file and classify them by rank   - token id - price I paid . She did something very useful so I gave her 20% more than what she needed to pay for the full year. 
And now I have a cool organised file for my toonz ☺️

Shaming and stating facts is 2 différents things. You think clearly you are never offended normally 🙂


[04-Apr-22 07:02 AM] Sigyn#0001
but yeah 2022 is the world where people get offended for pretty much everything I suppose . I don’t try to even if I play the brat often it’s always more humor and bratting around but I like datas and analyzing behavior that’s how most make it in crypto and even tradi market . If one thing left read what is an INTJ you’ll get how my brain works and why most people always complain about our « type »

Anyway - there for toonz community art team roadmap and fun at the end 💕

panic in the market = rekt 

Except if you get lucky AF you won’t EVER make it (as it needs learning and most don’t and won’t)

Panickers are the same buying the top, crying, selling the dip, doing it again all over again expecting a different outcome. 

I legitimately laugh at their depends. 

That’s how nature works and market too.

Sharks and fishes

I saw many peeps getting out from so many great projects (crypto no nft) I also see then repeating the same mistake loosing again and again - always with a small bag not able to grow much . Fact is,  5% actually change their journey to learn and grow. Not many more than that

Now people will need to avoid the rush if things go in the direction it should take - meaning fast floor growing up - that’s where you all want to sit and watch and not rush into selling 😉

You have many but just waiting for few days if it gets the momentum it  should get ^^


[06-Apr-22 02:36 PM] Sigyn#0001
The supply now is all about psychology. 
Anyone checking the collection will see « 900ish » listed . It’s like a direct shot of a strong drug. The hesitation most have will disappear and that’s where sales are growing super fast especially if maintained by the holders avoiding listing too fast / too many

thank you ❤️ people have NO IDEA how hard it is to just trying to hide truth behind glitters for people to not get "offended"
True INTJ here, we arent naturally programmed to say things nicely . Not because we are mean by nature but because we say things
raw as we dont know how to do different  🤣 even harder when you are a girl (im the 1% of the 1% of the INTJ 😄 ) I had regrets for how some reacted to some datas and comments I have made - it made me feel bad a loooot of time but the need to stating it was stronger despite I got a lot of hate from it. In life I dont see the necessity to add glitters to the truth and I will continue so I suppose I will still be called a toonz -bitch for a very long time.
Ok now, show me my next victim 🤣

50


[06-Apr-22 06:41 PM] Sigyn#0001
what I can say is... 

I have asked a favor to Bader and Prince. 

Both said **yes**

Omega/degen and maybe Alpha are gonna like it.

*Whale chan*

the less is listed (buy now or bid) 
the more its wanted

The more its wanted 
the more the price goes up

its fucking math. 

Demand and supply. 

Learn, grow your bag (and your knowledge of the market) 

Or keep playing with few eth while you could play in hundreds of eth in a year or 2.  Up to you. 
Only 2 or 3% of the current newbies will make it anyway (crypto including nft) Choose your gang.

Let me introduce you to Kevin 
:kev: 

He is not mean or anything but not the smartest Kevin of the world.

He like to buy the top and sell the dip
It’s been 2 years his bag has the same amount (more or less) 
Kevin also got rug many times , exit scammed some times and lost his passphrase as much .

Kevin likes to undercut anywhere he goes. That’s because he likes to be the first (at the bottom) and will always try his best to devalue even 0.001 if this can get him on top of the floor.

Kevin is a nice person tho but not very well educated. He likes to play football, love Big Macs , hold a lot of shitcoin and dream at night of becoming the next Elon musk.

This is the story of kevins

I suppose it’s useless to try to teach them anything


[07-Apr-22 02:17 PM] Sigyn#0001
Indeed but with yesterday stats we should have had our squeeze but no, people are stubborn not wanting to learn anything from the market


[07-Apr-22 02:17 PM] Sigyn#0001
And after we wonder why shitcoins are trending 🤣


[07-Apr-22 02:19 PM] Sigyn#0001
We will see. Idc if some doesn’t like some facts but we could have get a nice squeeze yesterday if we had less ignorance around


[07-Apr-22 02:21 PM] Sigyn#0001
I keep a close eye on sales . Some are 😉


[07-Apr-22 02:21 PM] Sigyn#0001
And there is bots playing with us because many kevins sell them for 0.35


[07-Apr-22 02:22 PM] Sigyn#0001
And bots that’s the issue


[07-Apr-22 02:22 PM] Sigyn#0001
bots are coded by people with a lot of money they don’t want to make x100 they want to make volume x1.2

Im positive but I’m also disappointed that we have so much ignorance in the space (in general not DT only)

The market clean itself often . Problem is, the idiots needs to be rekt a lot of times before quitting or some (very few) learning


[07-Apr-22 02:30 PM] Sigyn#0001
What did you learn from the rekt ? Was it like over leveraged on BINANCE or nft rekt ?


[07-Apr-22 02:31 PM] Sigyn#0001
most are crypto


[07-Apr-22 02:31 PM] Sigyn#0001

May I give you an advice ?


[07-Apr-22 02:33 PM] Sigyn#0001
Start to learn in crypto and come back in nfts after making a cool bag 😊 start by the start - the tech , the crypto, the market


[07-Apr-22 02:34 PM] Sigyn#0001
The thing is, nfts are way much harder to make Your bag big than learning the tech and market first using crypto , doing research

After you really need to make yourself some rules. Mine are :
- never touch unstress-tested chaines / not decentralized enough chains 
- never touch shitcoins 
- never touch non innovative projects (if someone already do it you must do better to be interesting) 
- never touch what I don’t have a use for it 
- never touch hype or unproven utility

It could be fine if made of smart peeps wanting to learn but no, of course not we get what ? casino gamblers. They get rekted all over again and leave broke but problem is, they are replaced by the exact same kind soon after their rekt-exit.

{Reactions}
👀 (3) 

[08-Apr-22 01:01 AM] Sigyn#0001
Let me introduce you to Kevin 
:kev: 

He is not mean or anything but not the smartest Kevin of the world.

He like to buy the top and sell the dip
It’s been 2 years his bag has the same amount (more or less) 
Kevin also got rug many times , exit scammed some times and lost his passphrase as much .

Kevin likes to undercut anywhere he goes. That’s because he likes to be the first (at the bottom) and will always try his best to devalue even 0.001 if this can get him on top of the floor.

Kevin is a nice person tho but not very well educated. He likes to play football, love Big Macs , hold a lot of shitcoin and dream at night of becoming the next Elon musk.

This is the story of kevins

Let me explain - if there is no interactions with the blockchain (meaning if there is no gas) a Signature cannot compromise your wallet (except if you are dummy enough to not have a ledger therefore your metamask can be hacked)

I see there is so much listed for high prices. It would be smarter to delist

not up..


[09-Apr-22 03:44 PM] Sigyn#0001
yes but it gives more values to have it delisted then listed at huge prices. The huge prices are basically pure useless


[09-Apr-22 03:44 PM] Sigyn#0001
it just add to the total supply avail


[09-Apr-22 03:44 PM] Sigyn#0001
its counter productive


[09-Apr-22 03:44 PM] Sigyn#0001
people need to be a bit more experienced


[09-Apr-22 03:45 PM] Sigyn#0001
yes it looks cool to have some crazy looking toonz at 10 eth but it doesnt help the project at its current state. It just add supply.


[09-Apr-22 03:45 PM] Sigyn#0001
I think, if the rares ones were delisted, all the high prices too, there would be at least 10% less on the suppply avail

yes


[09-Apr-22 03:51 PM] Sigyn#0001
your ledger is a layer of security.
the middle man handling your passphrase. Therefore, its the same as any time you bought or mint before. But here you have to validate with the hardware instead of nothing


[09-Apr-22 03:51 PM] Sigyn#0001
indeed you can mint with a hot wallet


[09-Apr-22 03:51 PM] Sigyn#0001
if you fear the approval you make


[09-Apr-22 03:51 PM] Sigyn#0001
and then send the nft to the cold storage (ledger)


[09-Apr-22 03:53 PM] Sigyn#0001
you did not turn on the blind signing thats why. keep it that way and continue using your hotwall if you can send to your ledger afterward ^^

You did not cover the BASIC of crypto not having a ledger - you got hacked which I feel for you but it’s actually your fault as you did zero research , you did nothing to protect your asset and you come here telling « pay my mistake back or the dude who bought it without knowing is screwed »

you realize that many people are building opensources bots for people to stop being ripped of by these ?

I give you an example


[11-Apr-22 05:15 PM] Sigyn#0001

[11-Apr-22 05:15 PM] Sigyn#0001

[11-Apr-22 05:15 PM] Sigyn#0001
so a team came up with an open source one


[11-Apr-22 05:16 PM] Sigyn#0001

[11-Apr-22 05:17 PM] Sigyn#0001

a ledger cost around 80$ for the nano S


[11-Apr-22 05:34 PM] Sigyn#0001
nano S is cheaper cause it cannot handle too many blockchains


[11-Apr-22 05:34 PM] Sigyn#0001
if you want to use many like I do (cosmos / btc / eth etc...) take the nao X

Wait ... you are gonna push a smart contract and project wallet on ... a hot wallet ? :9691_wut:


[11-Apr-22 05:40 PM] Sigyn#0001
Open store front ?


[11-Apr-22 05:40 PM] Sigyn#0001
do it using a smart contract


[11-Apr-22 05:40 PM] Sigyn#0001
Not open store front


[11-Apr-22 05:41 PM] Sigyn#0001
The store front means if open sea close, the nfts won’t exit anymore


[11-Apr-22 05:41 PM] Sigyn#0001
It’s not real nfts


[11-Apr-22 05:41 PM] Sigyn#0001
yeah


[11-Apr-22 05:41 PM] Sigyn#0001
that’s why there is zero store front ever on top sale on opensea


[11-Apr-22 05:42 PM] Sigyn#0001
Yeah because they do not know it


[11-Apr-22 05:42 PM] Sigyn#0001
you can get yourself a solidity dev on fiver it’s not expensive


[11-Apr-22 05:43 PM] Sigyn#0001
Or learn solidity


[11-Apr-22 05:43 PM] Sigyn#0001
there is standard already coded you can use


[11-Apr-22 05:44 PM] Sigyn#0001
OR you can use rarible they have smart contract ready to use but it cost gas at each mint


[11-Apr-22 05:44 PM] Sigyn#0001
And of course the price to deploy the contract in the blockchain


[11-Apr-22 05:44 PM] Sigyn#0001
not much indeed


[11-Apr-22 05:44 PM] Sigyn#0001
But they will appear on opensea


[11-Apr-22 05:44 PM] Sigyn#0001

[11-Apr-22 05:45 PM] Sigyn#0001

the generale market sentiment is btc and eth are in a huge range where most people doesnt know if its going south or north. The vast majority of regular nft trader watch what is happening on bayc and projects related more than they plan to invest (firstly because they cant) so quite not sure about that guy opinion tbh

the weekly volume of nfts is around 200millions. Yes, I said weekly....


[11-Apr-22 11:39 PM] Sigyn#0001
low volume comes from crypto market, not bayc projects.

im looking at the market. Not the nft only


[11-Apr-22 11:41 PM] Sigyn#0001
and yes, low volume comes from the market itself entirely. Not only nfts

Gift —> sold 1h later there is strictly nothing to say on top of that it’s plain disgusting - who does that ? What education to do it in front of the very one who gifted it ?

Because you don’t do that if you have education  and value

I wouldn’t - not raised with these values

That money did not exist in his life before Nil gifted him and if you have financial situation you are NOT in crypto in the first place. Sounds intolerant ? Yet it’s facts

I got a brat story. 

Years ago there was an important job I wanted. we were 30ish candidates.
I was the only girl.
the recruiter asked why I would be better than the others. 
I said I never accept a no 🤣 therefore I would get it and prove im better than all others candidates ( I make it short but that was the main discussion)
that person laughed and put me on the top list. At the last meeting I said that since I was in the top list, it means I had greater value than other candidates and so I would in turn accept the job if the salary was raised to the salary I was expecting. 

Guess what ? I got the job and I got the raise before even starting

oh I get a good one on this. A thing I heard a while ago. 
not having confidence means FEAR.

FEAR is a filter you have in your brain that is unrealistic most of time.
How can we demonstrate this ? 

take 2 boys at the beach. One jumps into the waves. The other is scared.
What makes them act different ? a filter one has which is fear. 

How to avoid ? ask this question : 
Whats the worst that can happen ? 
Is it realistically about to happen ? 
Generally speaking its always NO 

Then why the fear ? the filter. You control this filter, dont let it control you. 

So everytime you fear to do something, think about this filter that is unrealistic and made up of worst case scenario that will probably never happen. 

Fight 1 fire a day, do something you are scared to do everyday even a little one
And congrat yourself afterward and do more day after day 😉

If I write a list of what happened VS what i have accomplished so far it gives me so much strenght to continue and stay confident. Its maybe bad to say and hear but our traumas are a fucking strenght. All comes in 2 side of a medal. We are so stronger then those that had a peaceful life because we value little things more because of the shits that happened in the past

**Question for gamers** - would you rather play a game that has 4000 members and a prize pool for the top 20 (decreasing from the 1st to the 20) with a 1st place winning 150$ possible one time per week and with a prize pool that is growing bigger with time 

Or


50% of the  players all winning something when playing but with a super tiny rewards also growing with time ?


[12-Apr-22 08:37 PM] Sigyn#0001
Even if it’s a 4 up to 5k distributed monthly to these 50% ?


[12-Apr-22 08:38 PM] Sigyn#0001
Game is XP during the week and competition between all players 1 time or 2 time a week with money rewards


[12-Apr-22 08:38 PM] Sigyn#0001
Skills based not random tho


[12-Apr-22 08:40 PM] Sigyn#0001

Should I leak :kekwpixeled:


[12-Apr-22 08:44 PM] Sigyn#0001
you have a character that XP to get more advantage during the competition. 
Goal is to destroy banks / institutions and non-player characters representing our dear elite 🤣 

XP reset every x week (not determined fully yet how many weeks)
XP gives advantage such as speed.

once or twice a week there is a prize pool of around 1000$ (will grow with time as the money generated comes from DEFI and will grow with some of the royalties generated from the secondary market sale from the nfts characters.

You can rent some if you have many (more chance to win within the competition, delegating the XP and competition to secondary players also called scholars)

[12-Apr-22 09:54 PM] Sigyn#0001
a real nft is a smart contract coding and pushed into the blockchain


[12-Apr-22 09:55 PM] Sigyn#0001
or you can do a fake nft using opensea store front its all well explained in their pages 🙂 you will just have to create an owner page / push online your image


[12-Apr-22 09:55 PM] Sigyn#0001

ahhahah fortunately I dont shop irl 😄 IRL I am more into fancy hotels and restaurant, glad to not be triggered by clothes and stuff 😄 
Thats something that makes people confused all the time, we arrive in fancy restaurants with hoodies and basket, they all are watching us like we arent suppose to be there, then they see us ordering fancy wine and stuff and start acting almost normal, then they see the cryptocom card and start to be so friendly all of a sudden 😄 but they fail to get a nice tip when looking at us when we first got in 🤣

TURN it on - set up a new brand account/address in it (they ask for or new or existing) install ledger live, install the chains you need (eth for example) connect to MM get your addy, go to your other address, send to the new which is on ledger - done.

yeah I get that in the last couple of years people started to call these things bullying but Id like to say that it needs to stop.

[16-Apr-22 05:06 PM] Sigyn#0001
"be part of the community" is something I personally value, but yeah, I guess people can have different values. But I really dont think its fair or legitimate to show up to complain while having been away and never cared for the project.

not restricted to discord if you ask me and not restricted to be there 24/7 neither. There is some people that cannot afford a toonz and yet, come say hi often


[16-Apr-22 05:08 PM] Sigyn#0001
guys I say that because look at it with logic. You dont care to say hi but do to complain, sorry it doesnt make sense to me

But its not like it wasnt planned or came out of the blue. The people who dumped / flipped their toonz are selling the card right now, so we can buy it (I did x2) so they are still out and loyal holders like us are still in . We cannot complain about something that was clear and planned from the beginning. 

*At least out of respect for the team*

keep in mind this :


[16-Apr-22 06:58 PM] Sigyn#0001
to be at risk, you need to pay gas, do an actual tx on the blockchain. If you dont, you are safe


[16-Apr-22 06:58 PM] Sigyn#0001
EXCEPT if you dont have a ledger, and here a simple sign can compromise your wallet since you get NO security on it

Written in the roadmap since day 1 - how  would it look to change it ? Bad.

Now I’m gonna tell you what I said earlier. 

Here since reveal day. I did not mint. I hold near 60 toonz and I swept the floor countless times and spend time in here. If I don’t get upset not having one who could ?

@ngostalgic_ so ... you basically sent it to an address no staff has "full" access. 
it requires one big man to get in and use any that is in it. The people handling  wallets have limited powers and actions pre-attributed and when I say limited its super limited. Honestly, they could. They would have zero issue doing it because its an actual eth mainet address receiving an asset on the same chain. Meaning zero tech issues but ... they wont cause they will need a higher ranked guy to do it but wont call him to help. 

You can hope they add "nfts recovering" from mistaken sent address. These things takes months. 

**My advice** : long shot but try to find names of big guys working at coinbase, find their emails, socials etc... and contact them all.

coinbase work with the shadiest people on earth, have malicious code inside their USDC allowing them to freeze remotly assets even wrapped on second layers or so / on ledger outside CEX and have done it few times already. Coinbase is cancer, works with the shittiest people on eart (WEF) and knowing how they do, I would never trust them even with 100 bucks

2 transfers 
1 from 0xfd9 1 from xxxxkkk.eth from where the sell occured.

Both wallets arent empty, both have and eth/tokens and nfts. 
An hack is 90% of the time automated and retrieve or 100% of the wallet or a large part of it. (automated scripts/bots "withdraw all")

None of these 2 wallets interacting with the golden toonz are empty.

xD


[18-Apr-22 07:28 PM] Sigyn#0001
well, his wallet isnt empty, he has some nfts worth few eth and he has like 400$ of eth too + tokens


[18-Apr-22 07:28 PM] Sigyn#0001
chances are its indeed a fatfingering


[18-Apr-22 07:29 PM] Sigyn#0001
lollll


[18-Apr-22 07:29 PM] Sigyn#0001
I think (but I can be wrong) he sent it to another wallet to fud the gold under floor discreetly and fatfinger the pricing


[18-Apr-22 07:29 PM] Sigyn#0001
if its a hack, its a very strange one


[18-Apr-22 07:29 PM] Sigyn#0001
since his wallet is not empty


[18-Apr-22 07:29 PM] Sigyn#0001
and still has some very valuable nfts and eth

yeah me too , to see if the wallet gets emptied


[18-Apr-22 07:31 PM] Sigyn#0001
but its been few hours now so chances are its not


[18-Apr-22 07:31 PM] Sigyn#0001
or he gave an approve on a shady website for toonz collection only


[18-Apr-22 07:31 PM] Sigyn#0001
which is a rare method


[18-Apr-22 07:31 PM] Sigyn#0001
but it exist


[18-Apr-22 07:32 PM] Sigyn#0001

let see now if he did something wrong


[18-Apr-22 07:38 PM] Sigyn#0001
he minted with his address so he did not send it to a hot wallet to make tx's as simething he would have done in the past


[18-Apr-22 07:38 PM] Sigyn#0001
still investigating it

we are looking into it


[18-Apr-22 07:49 PM] Sigyn#0001
we tried to know what happened


[18-Apr-22 07:49 PM] Sigyn#0001
your wallet is still full


[18-Apr-22 07:49 PM] Sigyn#0001
the dude selling it has kept the money (which is very not frequent for a scammer that always take the money out asap)


[18-Apr-22 07:49 PM] Sigyn#0001
im so curious on what happened


[18-Apr-22 07:49 PM] Sigyn#0001
I was analysing your wallet


[18-Apr-22 07:49 PM] Sigyn#0001
what did you do to get hacked ?


[18-Apr-22 07:50 PM] Sigyn#0001
cause its not a wallet hack


[18-Apr-22 07:50 PM] Sigyn#0001
it a specific hack for toonz only which is freaking odd


[18-Apr-22 07:51 PM] Sigyn#0001
thats the thing, he doesnt try to hide anything and keeps a shitload of money on his address

and he only took the toonz ?


[18-Apr-22 07:52 PM] Sigyn#0001

1 smart contract / token targeting ?


[18-Apr-22 07:53 PM] Sigyn#0001
he only took 1 nft and left the most valuable he had


[18-Apr-22 07:54 PM] Sigyn#0001
thats very odd


[18-Apr-22 07:54 PM] Sigyn#0001
he can take all or 1 not "a bunch" or he ran out of time or fees


[18-Apr-22 07:54 PM] Sigyn#0001
this is so unique


[18-Apr-22 07:57 PM] Sigyn#0001
it was toonz targeted


[18-Apr-22 07:57 PM] Sigyn#0001
very very odd


[18-Apr-22 07:58 PM] Sigyn#0001
thats the thing here


[18-Apr-22 07:58 PM] Sigyn#0001
he did not stole the most expensive one


[18-Apr-22 07:58 PM] Sigyn#0001
wich is 4 eth floor on his wallet


[18-Apr-22 07:59 PM] Sigyn#0001

[18-Apr-22 08:02 PM] Sigyn#0001
there is no mint proceeded on your wallet mate


[18-Apr-22 08:03 PM] Sigyn#0001
im trying to catch the contract that did it


[18-Apr-22 08:03 PM] Sigyn#0001
any chance you still have the tx ?


[18-Apr-22 08:04 PM] Sigyn#0001
its super experimental and unique if what you said that happened happen in the way you say and as a tech nerd I'd love to know how


[18-Apr-22 08:05 PM] Sigyn#0001
the blockchain doesnt hide anything and here, there is something or super genius (hackers are fuckers but here if true its a genius proceeds)


[18-Apr-22 08:06 PM] Sigyn#0001
any chance you got the tx still ?


[18-Apr-22 08:06 PM] Sigyn#0001
where you got hooked up to a bad contract


[18-Apr-22 08:06 PM] Sigyn#0001
please 🙏


[18-Apr-22 08:06 PM] Sigyn#0001

[18-Apr-22 08:12 PM] Sigyn#0001
im beggin you 😄


[18-Apr-22 08:14 PM] Sigyn#0001

[18-Apr-22 08:35 PM] Sigyn#0001
please just the TX hash


[18-Apr-22 08:36 PM] Sigyn#0001
thats toonz contract


[18-Apr-22 08:36 PM] Sigyn#0001
its a tx from the smart contract of toonz


[18-Apr-22 08:36 PM] Sigyn#0001
not the "hacking website"


[18-Apr-22 08:38 PM] Sigyn#0001
you must approve something somewhere for it to act as a allowed to make any actions so no


[18-Apr-22 08:38 PM] Sigyn#0001

Do you have a ledger or any hardware ?


[18-Apr-22 09:37 PM] Sigyn#0001
and do you use iPhone ?


[18-Apr-22 09:37 PM] Sigyn#0001
And iCloud


[18-Apr-22 09:41 PM] Sigyn#0001
if your wallet is compromised you should move all your assets asap


[18-Apr-22 09:43 PM] Sigyn#0001
if your passphrase has leaked, it wont change anything


[18-Apr-22 09:46 PM] Sigyn#0001
you cant


[18-Apr-22 09:47 PM] Sigyn#0001
yes it can if you are fearless enough to not have a hardware


[18-Apr-22 09:48 PM] Sigyn#0001
imagine you have a hotwallet on ANY device (phone or PC) a single bad link can get the encrypted file where the passphrase is


[18-Apr-22 09:48 PM] Sigyn#0001
buy a ledger

[18-Apr-22 09:48 PM] Sigyn#0001
nope. someone can hack you simply (targeted)


[18-Apr-22 09:49 PM] Sigyn#0001
im confused honestly. The seller has a scammer-like wallet but you did not make any bad approvals (any) and he let you all your wallet beside the toonz


[18-Apr-22 09:50 PM] Sigyn#0001
never seen that in my life in crypto


[18-Apr-22 09:51 PM] Sigyn#0001
I know I saw


[18-Apr-22 09:51 PM] Sigyn#0001
but again,


[18-Apr-22 09:51 PM] Sigyn#0001
your wallet did not approve any sketchy contract


[18-Apr-22 09:51 PM] Sigyn#0001
and he let you all the nfts and money and only took the toonz which is strange if the man stole your passphrase


[18-Apr-22 09:51 PM] Sigyn#0001
the strangest thing I have ever seen


[18-Apr-22 09:51 PM] Sigyn#0001
but MOVE YOUR ASSETS


[18-Apr-22 09:51 PM] Sigyn#0001
on a new brand wallet


[18-Apr-22 09:51 PM] Sigyn#0001
asap


[18-Apr-22 09:52 PM] Sigyn#0001
exactly


[18-Apr-22 09:52 PM] Sigyn#0001
hackers uses scripts


[18-Apr-22 09:52 PM] Sigyn#0001
the line code is "withdraw all"


[18-Apr-22 09:52 PM] Sigyn#0001
they even take shitty stuff


[18-Apr-22 09:53 PM] Sigyn#0001
if by any weird situation the hacker has a broken script he will come back for more and will take it all


[18-Apr-22 09:53 PM] Sigyn#0001
you better go fast and move your nfts somewhere else


[18-Apr-22 09:54 PM] Sigyn#0001
what do you mean ?


[18-Apr-22 09:56 PM] Sigyn#0001
your wallet did not mint anything in the last 48h


[18-Apr-22 09:56 PM] Sigyn#0001
do you remember when it was ? and if so, go to metamask and find the trnasaction in "activity"


[18-Apr-22 09:57 PM] Sigyn#0001
yes


[18-Apr-22 09:57 PM] Sigyn#0001
or mint or approval - but there isnt any in his wallet in the last 7 days


[18-Apr-22 09:58 PM] Sigyn#0001
then you signed a transaction and should be in your meta fam 🙂


[18-Apr-22 09:58 PM] Sigyn#0001
or the scammer isnt done with you and will come back for the other assets if he got your passphrase


[18-Apr-22 09:59 PM] Sigyn#0001
even a 12 eth nft ?


[18-Apr-22 10:00 PM] Sigyn#0001
then the passphrase is at risk


[18-Apr-22 10:00 PM] Sigyn#0001
since he use a hotwallet and there is no approve


[18-Apr-22 10:00 PM] Sigyn#0001
few dollars it depends on the gas price


[18-Apr-22 10:01 PM] Sigyn#0001
could you give the link in DM please I want to see more


[18-Apr-22 10:02 PM] Sigyn#0001
remove your assets from the address. now.


[18-Apr-22 10:06 PM] Sigyn#0001
well if you think you are at risk you better yes

No one is but this is  a unique hack experimental and quite sophisticated at the same time


[18-Apr-22 11:58 PM] Sigyn#0001
at first and according to the blockchain which I’m sure you know shit all was indicating he was indeed lying so I and others spent more than 6h investigating

Yea that’s the new trend to hack nowadays

The hacker account is also down on your side or am I buggy ?


[19-Apr-22 12:08 AM] Sigyn#0001
Did you move your asset somewhere else in case of ?


[19-Apr-22 12:10 AM] Sigyn#0001
Send your nfts and tokens ETH etc... to a new wallet. After , order a ledger and move it there


[19-Apr-22 12:10 AM] Sigyn#0001
It was there 20min ago still


[19-Apr-22 12:10 AM] Sigyn#0001

Wait to have a ledger

[19-Apr-22 12:20 AM] Sigyn#0001
he knows already he wanted to be sure it was an hack as mentioned earlier it’s a very unique hack and on the blockchain I personally thought at first he was lying but kept searching for many hours to be sure and yes there is no proof but the seller is using tornado so still no idea why the hacker used such an unique method but it’s one indeed and Pkirbs wanted to be sure about it


[19-Apr-22 12:21 AM] Sigyn#0001

[19-Apr-22 12:22 AM] Sigyn#0001
Please buy a ledger

There isn’t much to find unfortunately - there is nothing on the blockchain side beside the huge amount of nft the dude stole

they are still delivering


[19-Apr-22 12:32 AM] Sigyn#0001
Mmm... you couldn’t discover this actually. If it was using a smart contract you could not find it as it’s already down on his DAPPS. Using a signature for hot wallet could do the trick but again no dapps running anymore to see the code used so please tell me where you find it and how cause this hack made me loose my entire day investigating it :kekwpixeled:

Well 3 things to know :
- having a staked land gets your WRLD Rewards - the rare lands gets more incentives for 4 years I think.
- some verified games have wrld faucet to pay off their gamers 
- all games are paying their players with WRLD


[19-Apr-22 07:40 PM] Sigyn#0001
And so need to buy


[19-Apr-22 07:40 PM] Sigyn#0001
Also BINANCE listing soon


[19-Apr-22 07:41 PM] Sigyn#0001
Selling the dip doesn’t sounds like a good move - with that token or any other 😁


[19-Apr-22 07:41 PM] Sigyn#0001
Many games are gonna launch and so will have to buy WRLD


[19-Apr-22 07:42 PM] Sigyn#0001
yes they already made the page

but they are cheap on informations 😄


[20-Apr-22 03:03 PM] Sigyn#0001
from my understanding, its animoca who launched the coin


[20-Apr-22 03:03 PM] Sigyn#0001
not bayc


[20-Apr-22 03:05 PM] Sigyn#0001
ok yeah I think its only related with the token


[20-Apr-22 03:06 PM] Sigyn#0001
for that they would need a WLRDland


[20-Apr-22 03:06 PM] Sigyn#0001
cause nftWRLD is building a door to go from 1 game to another


[20-Apr-22 03:06 PM] Sigyn#0001
I know


[20-Apr-22 03:06 PM] Sigyn#0001
our land is built on nftworlds


[20-Apr-22 03:07 PM] Sigyn#0001

[20-Apr-22 03:07 PM] Sigyn#0001
they got one ? (on nftworld)


[20-Apr-22 03:08 PM] Sigyn#0001
yeah so tell me how you bridge nftworlds minecraft framework built to a unity


[20-Apr-22 03:08 PM] Sigyn#0001
(or else )


[20-Apr-22 03:09 PM] Sigyn#0001
its already very tricky to do it with 2 same coded built


[20-Apr-22 03:09 PM] Sigyn#0001
yeah


[20-Apr-22 03:09 PM] Sigyn#0001
exactly


[20-Apr-22 03:09 PM] Sigyn#0001
unity to unity is already fucking difficult (and did not see one yet except plans to do one)


[20-Apr-22 03:10 PM] Sigyn#0001
so a bridge between to extremely different code built mmm... not yet


[20-Apr-22 03:10 PM] Sigyn#0001
thats because of animoca


[20-Apr-22 03:10 PM] Sigyn#0001
I really dont like animoca


[20-Apr-22 03:10 PM] Sigyn#0001
they are trying to centralized the whole p2e world


[20-Apr-22 03:11 PM] Sigyn#0001
and has made nothing valuable yet in p2e


[20-Apr-22 03:11 PM] Sigyn#0001

[20-Apr-22 03:11 PM] Sigyn#0001

nftworlds is as of now extremely decentralized and handled by DAO

so microsoft can put a finger in their asses while dancing in circle to get it for them 😄

im sure animoca handled the responsability for the token or so for the legal side

and give even more light (if they needed any) to bayc

for watching all traits daily or so , let me tell you, its true to think many people arent born with a functional brain


[22-Apr-22 03:33 PM] Sigyn#0001
there is the same dudes on the same floors where some of the trait are bought but like we all know , people choose their fav not the price


[22-Apr-22 03:33 PM] Sigyn#0001
and they just lower 0.01 each day


[22-Apr-22 03:33 PM] Sigyn#0001

if you bought it around january 2021, you might have get yourself the faulty one (there was a short serie of buggy ledgers)

**IF ANYONE wants the privilege to OWN a fur**

Its now or never before I change my mind.
I'll sweep the floor to use the momentum we are getting today.
I sell 1 for 6 eth otc with only people I know here. We can discuss the price
But not too much as I am already regretting it.

I agree at some point - what they did with their game asking for a KYC to mint might be their downfall (and deserved)

Open source means the code is public therefore anyone can make a metamask if the actual one has issues / stopped being fixed if bug etc..


[27-Apr-22 03:58 PM] Sigyn#0001
there is a great alternative called FRAME

When you see a traits "unchanged" for the total supply listed but a lower price floor it means the imbecile truly think lowering for 0.01 will make people buy it - Should we tell them ? Fucking Kevin :omg:

I dont buy something that has zero info, zero game mechanism public known and zero whitepaper, zero roadmap, zero economic modele on how the game will be . I understand people who did, but its nonetheless a very poor investment for individuals (projects owners not the same as its an asset to add to their own plans and roadmap)

[03-May-22 08:46 PM] Sigyn#0001
i feel I must tell to as much people as I can . No game in history of crypto has ever sold any nfts without a whitepaper. at the current stage, this is buying hope and hype and zero utility

The culture of buying hype with ZERO whitepaper before mint ? This is a TERRIBLE lesson to teach all the people out there with ZERO market or crypto education

What happen is the FED news is good for crypto and bad for market they are gonna explode the whole tradi market - people as the idiots they are got themselves under huge leverage on CEX and got cascade liquidated once again and so domino like it fell (Btc) for the tradi market it’s just decades of FAKE and manipulations of the market and the dollars and all central banks that are gonna fall to give a good needed reality check - society based on debt is nothing and worth nothing.

We **could** enter into bear but first it’s not validated yet and a short squeeze is also very likely . GET YOUR TOKENS OUT OF EXCHANGE it helps deepen the dip 😉

The state of the economy has barely nothing to do with war. That’s state propaganda . The economy is decades of manipulation. It can create huge volatility at best (as we saw few times) but short term except if huge crash of dollars or short pump of the same

**Important info regarding the toonzanalytics**
Most rare floor traits has been priced down. 
For example, many are for a few days at some floors for some traits. 
They thought changing the price by 0.01 will make them sell faster.

Anyone has some extra brain cell for them or ? ... 😄

I think the crypto space needs as much knowledge as possible right now, we need all to help each other, giving out the things we know to be passed on the next crypto-user

[12-May-22 05:06 PM] Sigyn#0001
there isnt as much coins per owners as exchanges owns


[12-May-22 05:06 PM] Sigyn#0001
I dont know how to explain 😄


[12-May-22 05:07 PM] Sigyn#0001
let me see if I see a good translation of it


[12-May-22 05:09 PM] Sigyn#0001
its not your coins when its on exchange (not your key not your coins)
so the exchange can (and always do) use your coins to manipulate order books and play with the price. If there is not much coins on their exchanges, they cannot do it too much because they will have the risk to be rekt themselves .


[12-May-22 05:12 PM] Sigyn#0001

There is more tokens owned by users on exchanges than the exchanges own itself - see the problem ? 😁


[12-May-22 05:27 PM] Sigyn#0001
So if people get the coins out it’s good for all of us

I know perfectly well the chain and let me tell you, if people were not stupid as fuck leveraging with a super tight liq price, it wouldnt have been that bad. there was a domino effect from anchor + mim + all other protocol where fucktards were leveraging their ass off.

At that pace with the data’s i have accumulated we should reach 1 eth in 48h max (if no change in morons behaviors) so even before if some consequential sales occurs during that time

So if you are under 1eth, it’s your final exit doors - goodbye 👋 (preferably, don’t come back 😆 talking to Kevins and no others of course 😉

what 99% of unfortunate scammed toonz have in common ?
The owner did not have a ledger....

If this can teach something to anyone here reading and not scammed yet while using a hot wallet, just know its a question of time. 
its not "if" its not "how" its about "when" you will also see your wallet empty.

**Note my words**

yes


[15-May-22 06:57 PM] Sigyn#0001
nope. this is false. a hot wallet has security issues that needs a very simple code to get the passphrase out and decyphered remotly - if I had to make it even more simple : having an IP address is enough to fuck a hot wallet


[15-May-22 07:01 PM] Sigyn#0001
selling something without allowances is already not possible. Believe me on word, my man is a blockchain developper (not a nft contract creator lol, he actually codes) the way you can fuck a hot wallet is easy.


[15-May-22 07:01 PM] Sigyn#0001

browser attack, pishing attack, ip attack, could attack I can make a long list. indeed the user is often the one fucking himself up but recently there was a so simple hack using chrome buggy code that allowed a shit load of wallets to get empty

whales arent whales by playing it stupid 🙂 
Besides the color of my name, did you noticed me selling 3 or 4 yesterday? 
dont worry, most whales dont sale at all and those doing it are selling very silently and very little along the way of the pump-waves 🙂

selling rares (or unwanted like the black eyes) along the way, replaced by floors and/or one I love more , taking profit along the way, keeping enough to still have weight, paying back slowly the investment while at the end being with only profit + many toonz. The bag is free if well planned

if things works out and you do this along the waves of pumps, you end up with many assets ending up as free + profit

**I truly think we are idiots** (me included with my ugly gold at floor) in regards of the rare ones.
The difference between the toonz floor and the rare traits floor is fucking pathetic. It should be very much higher not x3 from floor. Seriously we need to stand up our game, because right now we are brainless chickens. Think about it if you have a toonz listed with a trait as rare as minus 1% rarity. The only traits that is truly getting a reasonable price are the robots and the thriller - all others well... yeah, pathetic. And all of us listing are guilty. Gonna see what could be done as the floor ones on these rare traits are often people hidding in the dark or not in the server. 

We should brainstorm something around this because right now it opens the doors of soulessflippers getting one and breaking the floor later one for a quick buck.

too much of them to list on the toonzanalytics

big difference between the one listed at floor and the rest of the listed ones. Arbitrating this means buying the idiot undercutting very massively and relisting it near others

[18-May-22 07:51 PM] Sigyn#0001
If gas is paid it means you interact with a smart contract

[18-May-22 07:52 PM] Sigyn#0001
a signature , plugging the ledger to your computer, plugged to metamask etc cannot compromise it


[18-May-22 07:53 PM] Sigyn#0001
To make it simple - no gas fees paid = no risks (with hardware)


[18-May-22 07:55 PM] Sigyn#0001
Which is different for hot wallet (no hardware) they are different. Simply having metamask opened = a risk 🤣

Last but not least, Some of the rarest toonz of the entire collection, also robots, with a top 1% ranks are listed under the rest … Very sad for this list.  
 
**Possible arbitrage** 

- **Light purple background** : 2 listed at 3.6 / next at near 5 eth - **Arbitrage of 1.5 eth**
- **FIN background** : 2 listed at 6 / next at 8.5 - **Arbitrage of 2.5 eth**
- **Fur Jacket** : 2 listed around 5 / next at 8 - **arbitrage of 3 eth**
- ** Naked** : 2 listed at 3.3/3.75 / next at 4.25 - **arbitrage of min. 0.50 up to 0.95**
- **Glasses** : 1 listed at 2.5 / next at 3 - **Arbitrage of 0.50 eth**

WHEN SOMEONE FUCK WITH US its mandatory to point it out. 
but when someone plays it respectfully, its also normal to speak out.

Yesterday tooonzanalytics I named MSLONELYNFT the kevin of the day for listing the naked minus 1 ethereum under the floor. Legitimately saying that when you make a living out of the collection, you are required to at least show it some respect. at my biggest surprise, MSLONELYNFT delisted the toonz and relisted it +1eth above. So he deserves a big-up for this very respectable move. GG

@kryptobaby mate, why did you fucked the naked floor ? yours is beautiful !!! Even MslonelyNFT delisted to relist higher after we told him. So why fucking the work here ? 

Guys, there is a huge arbitrage to do. Kryptobaby listed on naked floor at 3, getoffmylawn is at 3.4 just after but his sale is expering in 30min, meaning the next avail will be at 4.25

but I swear yours is superb !!! You literally seat on 0.5 eth . If a dude wants a naked, even if you are at 2.5, if he doesnt like yours, he wont take it because its lower. If your toonz was not really good / not superb I would say yeah, def, listed way lower, but I promise yours is beautiful, you just have to wait for someone who likes it. You can def list at 4 near the third

mine has been listed for a week at 10 or 12 as I know these traits are bought for the look and not the price.


[22-May-22 01:42 PM] Sigyn#0001
so ..


[22-May-22 01:43 PM] Sigyn#0001
because its their fav. whats the issue ?


[22-May-22 01:44 PM] Sigyn#0001
then dont say its artifically pumped, it isnt. I do toonzanalytics for weeks I see traits and their floor every day. Naked is steady (among few others)

**Oversized t-shirt** - **8**/61 left  - 2.95 floor ———*( -4  / +0.01 )*
**Thriller** - **12**/70 left - 6.3 floor ——— *(unchanged / -0.31)*
**Suit** - **12**/75 left  - 2.98 floor ——— *( +2 /  -0.01)*

**Bulletproof** - **20**/168 left - 2.39 floor  ———*(-2 / -0.09)*
**Stone essentials** - 15/178 - 2.40 floor
**Silk robe** - **26**/181 left - 2.40 floor  ———*(+1 / -0.05 )* 
**Naked** - **16**/181 left - 3 floor  ——— *(-1 / -0.80 )*
**Biker Jacket** - **14**/181 left - 3 floor ——— *(-1 / unchanged)*
**bomber** **11**/190 left - 2.67 floor ——— * (-3 / +0.39)*
**Varsity** - **12**/200 left - 2.65 floor ——— *(-7 / +0.31 )*

**Surprised Eyes** - **21**/172 left - 2.59 floor  ———*(-2 / -0.30)*
**Degen Aviator** - **20**/186 left  - 2.65 floor ——— *(+1  / unchanged)*

**Tiger** - **40**/397 left - 2.99 floor ——— *(+1 / unchanged )*
**Paws** - **0**/3 left / —

**Total supply available** - 806 (-108) 
**Floor** 2.10 (+.18)
**201** before 3 ETH 

**Winner** :  Blue Hawaii have few listed everyday but with smart people holding it, no undercut floor stable at 3.3. Mamba has his supply listed divided by more than 2 ! Only 4 left !! Raise the floor !
**Looser** :  Space suit, floor at +0.1 then the collection floor while there is only 166 total supply. Makes no sense.  

**Possible arbitrage** 

- **Mamba jersey** : 1 listed at 3.25 / next at 4 - **Arbitrage of 0.75 eth**
- **FIN background** :1 listed at 5.35 / next at 7.5 - **Arbitrage of 1.85 eth**
- **Fur Jacket** : 1 listed at 5 / next at 8 - **arbitrage of 3 eth**
- **Oversized t-shirt** : 1 listed at 2.95 / next a 3.50 - **Small arbitrage of 0.55**
- **Naked** : Getoffmylawn listing will expire in 30, with kryptobaby undercut nice arbitrage from 3 to 4.25

nftinit


[22-May-22 05:11 PM] Sigyn#0001
what is interesting is the following : 
- nftinit is widely used
- all people who wants to see the datas of a project using this website most of the time also check the bluechip owner comparison
- we are in the bluechip projects by them (maybe on other website I'll check this)
- so every person looking out the datas on nftinit have a great chance to see us in the bluechip thingy if few of us are holding any projects looked at there. 

So yeah, its a very very good news, especially if nftinit isnt alone adding us in this

were you scammed ? I can only advise you to NOT report it as someone in here could get it and deal something with you. The scammer will always find a way to sell it, but its the new owner that will get fucked

I think it’s obvious but lack of research and learning makes it important to tell : ** any free nft, tokens are always a scam** don’t interact with it. If you think some money just randomly ended up in your wallet you have some knowledge issues to fix right now. The space isn’t safe without the minimum of required knowledge. Start leaning the tech and the safety mesures NOW. 🔥

[23-May-22 08:46 PM] Sigyn#0001
its against the law to steal


[23-May-22 08:46 PM] Sigyn#0001
I dont see what regulations could be made on top of that since it exist already bud


[23-May-22 08:47 PM] Sigyn#0001
but its already the case. Imagine you get your toonz stolen. You go to the police to report a thief.


[23-May-22 08:47 PM] Sigyn#0001
but the thing is, scammers use tornado


[23-May-22 08:47 PM] Sigyn#0001
its untraceable


[23-May-22 08:49 PM] Sigyn#0001
it would be pointless indeed. Let me explain if I may.

Someone stole your nfts.
He quickly sell it 
he is using a "trash" wallet (meaning never used before for anything else)
he sells your assets
he send the money into tornado (a mixer to anonymize the transaction)
the money is sent to a clean wallet, the clean wallet send the money to binance, 
he cashes out. 
not traceable.

[23-May-22 08:51 PM] Sigyn#0001
so there is literally no law possible as it falls into the thief crime. 
now yeah, regulations is another topic. 
making forbidden to have an anon wallet (meaning all your ethereum address must be cleared by binance to be allowed to cash out)
it kills the anonymity crypto was made for so it goes against the very principle satoshi nakamoto coded it for. Thats why education is needed because regulations is an absolute no go .


[23-May-22 08:51 PM] Sigyn#0001
thats why its important to explain it all to everyone

i would add, those that think they are invisble and smarter than those who have done the job to know how the tech works and so how the security works too. lazyness is 90% the reason assets gets stolen and wallet emptied imo

Its hard when you spent your life in here because people knows you and so it becomes hard to sell anything even tho people tend to call out the slightest sale but dont seem to remember all the sweeping done when stuff were bad , floor down and people fudding here. So yeah, please, avoid to ask me why I take profit while I have (among many others) supported every dip we got and raised it up by massive sweeps.

**thank you**

some people miss very basics market knowledges. I have seen some rare traits today I had to remove. they are less than 1% and yet their floor (not only one but many) are near collection floor. At least now, the 2.80ish price to enter the family is too high for the stupidiest and we shall see less of that with time

[25-May-22 04:29 PM] Sigyn#0001
yes of course, but more like, (this one wont be popular 😄 ) the higher the entry price is, the higher is the knowledges and intelligence and/or experiences of the people joining and so idiotic moves are less to be seen

someone might have told him, im giving you this amount of weth for your toonz and you avoid royalties fees on OS
the victim accepts
the scammers send a fake weth token 
the victim see the transaction of a weth but doesnt check its a real token
accept the sale on OS for 0.0001 to make the transfer
the victim then realize the token is a fake one


[25-May-22 04:53 PM] Sigyn#0001
= the price of not doing any tech/blockchain research

dogs now went from peeing on trees to scam on discord. What an evolution I must say :pepe:


[27-May-22 06:27 PM] Sigyn#0001
best thing would be to go to nftinit, click on a popular trending collection and click on bluechip comparison


[27-May-22 06:27 PM] Sigyn#0001
and see many of them there


[27-May-22 06:32 PM] Sigyn#0001
do you know how I recognized the picture ? 😄 
I click on every dogo pics
+ you want to access the marketplace despite you just arrived which is done my 99,99% of scammers I mean, come on. The market sucks already enough for most people, if you have some skills, try to scam a bankster at least it will be a public utility service


[27-May-22 06:33 PM] Sigyn#0001
not a guy and yes I do


[27-May-22 06:33 PM] Sigyn#0001
no need to


[27-May-22 06:33 PM] Sigyn#0001
well you wont access the marketplace chann anyway so


[27-May-22 06:34 PM] Sigyn#0001
the marketplace is called OpenSea


[27-May-22 06:34 PM] Sigyn#0001
yet you just joined and wants to access the market chann


[27-May-22 06:34 PM] Sigyn#0001
no I worry about my toonz fam


[27-May-22 06:35 PM] Sigyn#0001

I keep a file with all scammers avatars, names, heigh, weight, social security numbers that comes by in my computer.

[27-May-22 06:38 PM] Sigyn#0001
dont ever come in europe


[27-May-22 06:39 PM] Sigyn#0001
lets do this on a very simplier way. 
if there is 0.00001% the fact you want to access marketplace 2min after arriving, having the same avatar as a scammer from only few days ago, isnt a scam attempt, I apologize with honesty. If you are like the odds tells me you are a scammer, just know I will stay around to see if you do sketchy things and your chances wont be high. works for you  ?


[27-May-22 06:42 PM] Sigyn#0001
Like I said, if im wrong, Im sorry, take this as people caring for the members. Everyday someone loose his toonz and everyday you know where it starts ? people trying to access marketplace (chan)

no no I was talking about the server chann - all scammers tries to access there to scam those who try to sell


[27-May-22 06:44 PM] Sigyn#0001
you cant loose an nft accessing OS


[27-May-22 06:45 PM] Sigyn#0001
I swear on my life the avatar was a light beige puppy face in front of the camera with a side angle like yours. I start to think the 0,0001% is on me 🤣 for that I am sorry **if** you are legit. Im chill, but like Mang0Man said, there is a fat wave of scams lately


[27-May-22 06:48 PM] Sigyn#0001
**no marketplace is safe if the link is not official**, 
if the saler/buyer send you a link (can look the same and be a fake)
if the weth isnt checked as the official token (yeah, fake weth, it exists)
if the trade using an escrow is wrongly done
if the nft is from a fake collection 

I'll keep repeating -->
Dont OTC (private sale in DM) except if you know very well that person
very active in here
known by most OG's
using a middle man of high trust too

@Glabuz see ? (few messages above)


[27-May-22 07:12 PM] Sigyn#0001
Discord / opensea etc... should have a questionary before joining / buying / signing a transaction with the first time like : 
- Check if you know what a harware wallet is
- Check if you own one
- Check if you know how to recognize a scam link/nft
- Check and tell us how to keep your assets safe

the dude doesnt check gets the message

**Sorry, you arent safe enough to join crypto/nft, come back later when you did the minimum security checks**

its a 30% discount on the trait, its sad : (


[28-May-22 02:56 PM] Sigyn#0001
I wish you luck but believe me, you can list higher. If you want to be at floor while getting a fair price, you can list at 3.39 (its not they dont want yours, its because the volume everyhwere are dead)

I see the stats everyday since weeks, believe me, if someone wants cheap he will take yours even higher, if someone wants a specific one, yours will be skipped no matter the price 😉

**TOONZANALYTICS**
*Performance over 24h* 
*No arbitrage, not enough volume/too risky*


**Light background** - **8**/74 left  - 3.5 floor ———*(-1 / unchanged )*
**Fin background** - **15**/78 left  - 6.25 floor  ———*(unchanged / -0.75)* Bobby Lighting a fin zombie biker at floor is absolutely ridiculous, please come back to your senses 
**Beige broken** - **14**/130 left - 2.90 floor ——— *(+4/ -0.40)* 
**Red broken** - **21**/152 left -2.6 floor  ———*(+4 / -0.80 )*

**Surprised Eyes** - **23**/172 left - 3.50 floor  ———*(+1 / -0.35)*
**Degen Aviator** - **18**/186 left  - 3.90 floor ——— *(+2  / unchanged)*

**Fur jacket** - **10**/49 left  - 9.50 floor  ———*(unchanged / unchanged )* 
**Oversized t-shirt** - **11**/61 left  3.49 floor ———*( +1  / -0.50 )*

**Gold** - **16**/114 left  - 9 floor ——— *( -2  / unchanged)*
**Tiger** - **39**/397 left - 3.45 floor ——— *(-4 / -0.30 )*
**Paws** - **0**/3 left / —

**Total supply available** -869 (+2) 
**Floor** 2.169 (+0.04) 
**113** before 3 ETH (+26) 

**Winner** :  Let say Fur jacket that clearly has the best holders with no undercut, no more listing, just patience and trust 
 **Looser** : FIN with a zombie biker fin bg listed at floor. choking. The best snipe someone could do rn. 


**DISCLAIMER**
THE VOLUME IS LOW ON THE ENTIRE BLOCKCHAIN. NOT TOONZ, NOT NFTS, THE WHOLE ETHEREUM NETWORK. 
CRASHING YOUR TRAIT’S FLOOR IS AT BEST MORONIC. THINKING ITS TOONZ ONLY PROVES ONLY A  LAUGHABLE LACK OF KNOWLEDGES. USE THAT VERY CALM MARKET TO GO LEARN A TINY BIT ABOUT THE TECH, THE MARKET, AND NFTS. That’s the best one can do instead of panicking. You will come out from this terrific market smarter ❤️

**One data for you guys :** *The market started to die in ethereum and nfts 3 days or so ago. Since that, toonz never got a lower floor (see my last toonzanalytics) instead, we everyday got +.03. Its not much but we do better than 99% of the others. So please, keep this in mind <3*

**some other stats for new comers :** 
- a warner bros exec in yesterday's twitter space
- snoop dogg has 1
- rebel wilson has 2 
- a long list of celebs have some too (like 20 or more)
- mutated toonz coming
- generation 2 of bunny in the future
- nftworld land and game on it being built
- toonz token in the future
I can go on but if you're not a flipper but a smart money long term investors, the price doesn't matter and with the dip we have rn, this is the best time to join our fam 😉

we kept going up by 0.04 each day since the market died


[29-May-22 04:11 PM] Sigyn#0001
everyday


[29-May-22 04:12 PM] Sigyn#0001
your tiny small undercut could send us on the other way


[29-May-22 04:12 PM] Sigyn#0001
1 bad move can reverse that

the price isnt realistic right now as the pricing doesnt reflect the value since the volume on nfts are dead since 4 days now


[29-May-22 06:46 PM] Sigyn#0001
I would recommend you to get few floors if you want to play the dynamite thingy 😉


[29-May-22 06:47 PM] Sigyn#0001
if the volume did not die on the entire market few days ago, I realistically think it would be around 30% above


[29-May-22 06:47 PM] Sigyn#0001
snipe a rare after the dynamite drop , get floor to get few dynamites and snipe a rare after the drop as it should go a bit lower since we have some flippers amongs us


[29-May-22 06:48 PM] Sigyn#0001
thats what I would do if I was joining toonz now
